    "markdown": "# Course Descriptions\n\n## Core Courses\n\n### Pre-Program Bootcamp: Programming in R and Python\n\nThe Georgetown Data Science & Analytics program gives an online course in programming preparation that covers R, Python, and command line use in the summer prior to matriculation. The course is equivalent to three credits, is designed for matriculating MS Data Science & Analytics students, and is offered free of charge. It is required for all incoming students. This course will run during the Georgetown Summer Session (May – August). Students must complete this course to matriculate in the fall.\n\n### DSAN 5000: Data Science and Analytics\n\nThis course introduces students to several core data science concepts. It teaches students how to synthesize disparate, possibly unstructured data to better understand and characterize the world, and in some cases, to draw meaningful inferences. Topics covered include: the history of data science, successes and failures in data analytics, the data analytics life cycle, data/web scraping and APIs, data wrangling, data characterization (correlations, identifying clusters and associations), data inference and basic machine learning, network analysis, data ethics, and visual analytics. Students will work on a semester-long data science project that starts with question formulation and data collection, and goes through all the stages of the life cycle, culminating in data storytelling. The course also maps data science case studies to topics presented throughout the semester. _Prerequisites: Intermediate coding experience in Python3, and knowledge of introductory statistics. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5100: Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Computing\n\nProbabilistic models are essential for the understanding of data that are affected by uncertainty. This course introduces students to the fundamentals of probabilistic modeling and then covers computational techniques for the analysis of such data. After introducing basic concepts and approaches such as probability distributions, random variables, and conditioning, the course covers basic probability distributions that are frequently used in practice and some of their properties, such as Laws of Large Numbers. In the second half, students will learn about computational techniques for the use of probabilistic models. This includes methods for faithful simulation of random variables (Monte Carlo), the extraction of condensed models from observed data (maximum likelihood, Bayesian models), methods for models with hidden or partially observed variables (latent variables, expectation-maximization, hidden Markov models), and some general data science techniques that incorporate probabilistic models (graphical models, stochastic optimization). _Prerequisites: Introductory statistics, some coding experience (e.g. R). 3 credits. **Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5200: Advanced Data Visualization\n\nPresenting quantitative information in visual form is an essential communication skill for data professionals. This course introduces representation methods and visualization techniques for complex data, drawing on insights from cognitive science and graphic design. Students will obtain an overview of the human visual system, learn to use models for data and for images, and acquire good design practices, such as those using the “grammar of graphics.” Students will use common statistical design tools such as graphic methods in Python3, interactive graphic methods such as Bokeh, Leaflet, and NetworkD3, the R package ggplot2, and Tableau. _Prerequisites: DSAN 5000. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5300: Statistical Learning\n\nStatistical Learning is concerned with algorithms that use statistical techniques to find structure or patterns in given data (unsupervised learning) or use given instances of data to predict outcomes in new cases (supervised learning). A well-known method of this type is linear regression, and this will be covered early in the course. Statistical methods for making discrete predictions (classification) such as logistic regression will also be covered. Special emphasis will be placed on techniques for handling high-dimensional data (i.e. instances with many attributes), including variable selection and dimension reduction. The course will also cover ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting that are often used to improve the results of given classification methods. Unsupervised methods covered in this course include model-based and hierarchical clustering. _Prerequisites: DSAN 5100. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6000: Big Data and Cloud Computing\n\nToday’s data scientists are commonly faced with huge data sets (Big Data) that may arrive at fantastic rates and in a broad variety of formats. This core course addresses the resulting challenges. The course will introduce students to the advantages and limitations of distributed computing and to methods of assessing its impact. Techniques for parallel processing (MapReduce) and their implementation (Hadoop) will be covered, as well as techniques for accessing unstructured data and for handling streaming data. These techniques will be applied to real world examples, using clusters of computational cores and cloud computing. _Prerequisite: Working knowledge of Python and the Unix command line, some knowledge of data structures and DSAN 5000. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n## Elective Courses\n\n### DSAN 5400: Computational Linguistics – Advanced Python\n\nThis course presents topics in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Python programming. The goal of this class is to explore techniques in NLP, with a strong emphasis on hands-on instruction that progressively matures basic Python users into expert Python developers. We will examine topics such as text classification, model evaluation, machine translation, and distributed representations. Throughout the semester, students will select and read a book on AI ethics to motivate discussions on the social impact of modern NLP technologies. Applications include authorship identification, retrieval, and textual similarity, to name a few.\n\nAbout half of the total class time is devoted to addressing an essential but often neglected piece in software development education: moving from typical data science programming workflows (such as writing basic scripts) to developing sophisticated Python projects. In other words, students will learn to design professional-grade software that they and others will be proud to contribute to together. Programming topics are explored in great depth, including Python best practices, object-oriented design, project structuring, and more. This class will give students the skills they need to contribute to the professional software repositories they work with already and even develop their own. _3 credits_. _**Offered in the Fall and Spring semesters.**_\n\n### DSAN 5450: Data Ethics and Policy\n\nThis graduate-level course will train students to navigate the landscape of ethical issues which inevitably arise, across a variety of fields and industries, in each step of the data science process. Students will explore and critically evaluate a range of data-related issues in contemporary society, such as responsible data collection, algorithmic bias, privacy, transparency, accountability, democratic participation in data usage and data-driven decisions, and the ethical implications of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning (self-driving cars, ChatGPT, crowd-sourced training data, etc.).\n\nThrough a combination of theoretical discussions and real-world case studies, students will examine the profound public policy and social issues associated with data ethics. This course will empower students by introducing a set of general ethical frameworks (consequentialism, deontological ethics, and virtue ethics) and discussing their relative strengths and weaknesses in terms of their ability to address modern ethical dilemmas and guide ethical decision-making processes in business, healthcare, government, and academia. These theoretical frameworks will then be discussed in light of more practical regulatory and policy considerations, so that students will have the tools they need to draw conclusions (in the form of their final projects) about best practices for data handling within a particular field or topic of interest to them.\n\nThe course will thus equip students with a robust ethical “toolbox” for conscientiously gathering, interpreting, and extracting meaning from data while respecting privacy, fairness, transparency, democratic accountability, and other social concerns. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5500: Data Structures, Objects, and Algorithms in Python\n\nThe  Data Structures, Objects, and Algorithms in Python course will look at built-in data structures, such as dictionaries, lists, tuples, sets, strings, and frozen sets.

Applications will include data science problems. _Prerequisite: A working or intermediate knowledge of Python. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5550: Data Science and Climate Change\n\nData Science, as a key component of Artificial Intelligence, is helping shape profound changes to society.  An equally forceful phenomenon affecting our world is climate change.  This course will investigate the myriad ways Data Science can be used to address climate change.  This will include aspects of climate change which Data Science is already beginning to tackle, such as mitigating emissions from the five most carbon-intensive societal activities – energy, manufacturing, agriculture / land use, transportation, and buildings / infrastructure.  We will also look at Data Science’s emerging role in areas such as climate modeling, biodiversity conservation, carbon capture, climate mitigation finance, geoengineering, climate ethics, and reducing the carbon footprint of Data Science itself.  We will see how the following Data Science and Machine Learning topics can be used to address climate change: regression, gradient boosting, causal inference, interpretability, optimization, image processing, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, time-series analysis, and several neural network architectures.  Using a variety of existing data sources, students will undertake a final project of their choosing to apply a Data Science technique to an aspect of climate change. _Prerequisite: DSAN 5000. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5600: Applied Time Series for Data Science\n\nThe analysis of experimental data collected at different time points presents a fascinating challenge in the realm of statistical modeling and inference. The inherent correlations in Time Series introduced by the sampling of adjacent time points can significantly constrain the applicability of traditional statistical and Machine Learning techniques directly, which often rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed observations. This course offers a systematic exploration of these challenges through the lens of Time Series Analysis, providing students with the tools to unravel the mathematical and statistical complexities associated with temporal dependencies.\n\nThe class ventures into multifaceted aspects of time series analysis, encompassing traditional models such as ARIMA, SARIMA,ARFIMA,  Multivariate TS: VAR, ARIMAX, SARIMAX and VARMAX as well as specialized domains such as Financial Time Series modeling: ARCH, GARCH, GJR-GARCH, E-GARCH, M-GARCH models, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models,Spectral Analysis, and harness the potential of Deep Learning techniques: Fully recurrent(RNN),Long short-term memory (LSTM),Gated recurrent unit (GRU),  Bi-directional, Continuous-time, etc ,Transformers for Time Series data.\n\nIn this course, students will acquire a robust analytical skill set, encompassing model fitting, statistical methods, data visualization, and data storytelling. This course will include structured programming with the R and python languages.\n\nOne of the distinctive features of this course is its emphasis on practical applications. Students will have the opportunity to delve into real-world analysis across diverse domains, including but not limited to, Stock Market Analysis, where students explore intricate financial time series, Econometrics involving the application of time series analysis to economic data for forecasting macroeconomic indicators and market trends, COVID-19 Impact Analysis, Climate Data Analysis, and more. Additionally, students will undertake self-directed time series analysis projects, a mini capstone project, allowing them to apply their acquired skills to areas of personal interest, culminating in the creation of a comprehensive portfolio(a website)—a testament to their proficiency in handling complex temporal data across multifaceted domains.\n\nThis course equips students not only with theoretical knowledge but also practical skills that are invaluable in tackling real-world data challenges across a wide spectrum of applications. It is recommended that students know multivariate calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics at the undergraduate level. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5650: Causal Inference for Computational Social Science\n\nThis course provides students with the opportunity to take the analytical skills, machine learning algorithms, and statistical methods learned throughout their first year in the program and explore how they can be employed towards carrying out rigorous, original research in the behavioral and social sciences. With a particular emphasis on tackling the additional challenges which arise when moving from associational to causal inference, particularly when only observational (as opposed to experimental) data is available, students will become proficient in cutting-edge causal Machine Learning techniques such as propensity score matching, synthetic controls, causal program evaluation, inverse social welfare function estimation from panel data, and Double-Debiased Machine Learning.\n\nIn-class examples will cover continuous, discrete-choice, and textual data from a wide swath of social and behavioral sciences: economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, quantitative history, and digital humanities. After gaining experience through in-class labs and homework assignments focused on reproducing key findings from recent journal articles in each of these disciplines, students will spend the final weeks of the course on a final project demonstrating their ability to develop, evaluate, and test the robustness of a causal hypothesis. **Prerequisites: DSAN 5000, DSAN 5100. 3 credits. Offered in the Summer semester.**\n\n### DSAN 5700: Blockchain Technologies for Data Science\n\nThis course is designed to provide hands-on experience in building public and private blockchains. Students will gain the critical insight, practical knowledge, and technical skills required to design and integrate successful blockchain technologies into a business domain. The course covers the basics of Blockchain technologies including decentralized ledgers, consensus mechanisms, Public and Private key cryptography, smart contracts, etc. The class also examines the public policy and social issues addressed by and arose from adopting blockchain technology in finance, supply chain, and healthcare. The course utilizes Blockchain services (such as Azure) to teach blockchain development on platforms such as Ethereum (or other) and provides the necessary path for learning to build Blockchain networks at scale. Blockchain technologies (distributed ledger, smart contracts, etc.) are a new paradigm in data management and sharing technologies. Gartner Technology hype cycle predicts blockchain to be the industrial ready phase in the next five years. Students will take a deep dive into organizations with integrated blockchain technologies as part of their business strategy. Blockchain’s mainstream use by firms like Walmart, Merck, BlackRock will mean that our Data Analytics program graduates will be interacting with the technology often and will require expertise in handling, extracting, converting data to and from the blockchain. This course will provide an early introduction to the graduates, making them Blockchain-ready. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5800: Advanced Natural Language Processing\n\nThis course provides a formalism for understanding the statistical machine learning methods that have come to dominate natural language processing. Divided into three core modules, the course explores (i) how language understanding is framed as a tractable statistical inference problem, (ii) a formal yet practical treatment of the DNN architectures and learning algorithms used in NLP, and (iii) how these components are leveraged in modern AI systems such as information retrieval, recommender systems, and conversational agents. In exploring these topics, the course exposes students to the foundational math, practical applications, current research directions, and software design that is critical to gaining proficiency as an NLP/ML practitioner. The course culminates in a capstone project, conducted over its final six weeks, in which students apply NLP to an interesting problem of their choosing. In past semesters students have built chatbots, code completion tools, stock trading algorithms, just to name a few. This course assumes a basic understanding of linear algebra, probability theory, first order optimization methods, and proficiency in Python.\n\n_This is an advanced course. Suggested prerequisites are DSAN 5000, DSAN 5100 and DSAN 5400. However, first-year students with the necessary math, statistics, and deep learning background will be considered._ _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5900: Digital Storytelling\n\nTo be successful, a data scientist needs to have many skills beyond coding. This course will teach you how to communicate your findings and data to users, clients, stakeholders to make the biggest impact on your organization and your career. The course consists of two types of activities: lectures and exercises. Lectures provide a theoretical foundation of storytelling; the exercises are designed to help you learn practical skills that work best for different audiences. You will learn what fits your personal style and practice the power of storytelling that can inform and influence decision-makers.\n\nWriting topics will include technical writing, writing for action, and writing for communication in data science with respect to non-technical readers. Storytelling and visualization topics will include methods for presenting results as conclusions, presenting results as actionable items, and creating visual narratives. Interactive visualizations will focus not only on clearly illustrating information within data for use in decision-making, but also for use in discovery and exploration, as well as question generation. Topics in expression, color use, and style will be included _._ You will learn how to make a point with your charts, and how to make your charts clear to the audience. Further topics in the area of information presentation will include speaking with clarity to a team, group, or large audience.\n\nAll parts of the course will contain applications that focus on the utilization of the results of data science and analytics to promote public good, to encourage social concerns and equality, and to support change in areas such as business, public health, and public policy. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5925: Internship\n\nAn internship provides the student with practical work experience. This course enables international students to do internships at US companies. Students must obtain the approval from the Program Director and submit a Curricular Practical Training (CPT) form to proceed with an internship under this course. To be approved, an internship must be aligned with the Data Science and Analytics program goals and provide a significant learning experience for the student. At the end of the internship, the student must submit a deliverable to the course instructor, _0.25 credits._ (The program does not require students to complete an internship.) _**Offered every semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6150: Biological and Biomedical Data Science\n\nWe are bombarded everyday with multiple claims of health risks (doing this will ruin your health), new treatments and cures (just take this for 30 days for a new you), and better lifestyle choices. How are these claims made, evaluated and validated using data science? Data drives our knowledge of biology, disease and effective treatments. This data is diverse, complex, large, and in many respects unique. This data drives our understanding of whether risk factors or treatments causally change our health outcomes, whether our genes or our environment affects our health, and decisions about drugs, protocols and public health that affect all of us everyday. In this class we explore this rich, diverse data landscape and the specialized methods needed to make sense of it, leveraging the instructor’s decades-long experience in collaborative epidemiological and biomedical research across academia, government and industry. We will explore designing good experiments to extract causal relationships, and how we might still make valid decisions even in non-ideal settings. We will explore high-dimensional multivariate data and evaluate the validity of finding a “needle in a haystack” biomarker that can be targeted for treatment. We will see how statistical modeling (survival analysis in particular), machine learning, AI, and explainable AI have made an impact in helping us understand this world within. We will see how data-driven decision making using Bayesian analysis works. This journey will take us through real-life applications in bioinformatics (understanding how genes, proteins and other molecular markers affect disease), epidemiology (how do diseases spread and how interventions can prevent it) and clinical research (clinical trials, observational studies, case-control studies). DSAN 5100 is a prerequisite. However, first-year DSAN students with the necessary statistics background will be considered. _3 credits_. _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6300: Database Systems and SQL\n\nThis course will explore several aspects of modern database management systems, database programming, relational databases, semi-structured databases, and SQL.

These include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning (RL). The discipline of reinforcement learning focuses on how intelligent agents learn to perform actions, inside a specified environment, to maximize a cumulative reward function. Over the past several decades, there has been a push to incorporate concepts from the field of deep-learning into the agents used in RL algorithms. This has spawned the field of deep reinforcement learning. To date, the field of deep RL has yielded stunning results in a wide range of technological applications. These include, but are not limited to, self-driving cars, autonomous game play, robotics, trading and finance, and Natural Language Processing. This course will begin with an introduction to the fundamentals of traditional, i.e. non-deep, reinforcement learning. After reviewing fundamental deep learning topics the course will transition to deep RL by incorporating artificial neural networks into the models. The course includes a coding emphasis to showcase applied implementations of RL within the python ecosystem. Topics include multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, function approximation via neural networks, Markov decision processes, Monte Carlo methods, temporal difference learning, deep Q-learning, actor-critic methods, and policy gradient methods. Students must have intermediate coding experience in Python as well as knowledge of introductory statistics and multivariable calculus. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6700: Machine Learning App Deployment\n\nThis course will focus on gathering data so as to build an ensemble of machine learning methods that can predict, classify, and explore data entered by a client. This is an applied class that will engage in the steps required to create and deploy online a ML application that can be utilized by a client. Topics will include a very brief review of common ML techniques including NB, SVM, DT, RF, ARM, NN, and clustering. APIs will be used to gather, explore, clean, and prepare data for training a ML model ensemble. The model will be deployed via a client-server web application to enable clients to enter data and receive a classification or prediction. _Prerequisite: DSAN 5000. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6725: Applied Generative AI for AI Developers\n\nThis course is designed for AI developers aiming to build cutting-edge Generative AI (GenAI) applications. Focusing on the applied side of AI, students will explore key techniques such as in-context learning (ICL), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), AI agents, and responsible AI principles. The course covers advanced tools and methods, including embedding models, inference optimizations (e.g., quantization, multi-adapter swapping), fine-tuning of pre-trained models and benchmarking LLMs. Students will gain hands-on experience with open-source tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and platforms such as AWS, applying their skills in practical GenAI applications. The course culminates in a capstone project, preparing participants to deploy scalable, optimized AI systems in real-world scenarios. This course bridges the gap between data science knowledge and applied AI development, empowering students to solve industry-level challenges. _This is an advanced course open to second-year students. However, first-year students may register with permission from the instructor. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6750: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Applications\n\nGeographic Information Systems (GIS) are used as tools for describing, analyzing, managing, and presenting information about the relationships between geographical and spatial locations, sizes, and shapes. This is known as attribute data. GIS uses techniques that can represent social and environmental data as a map, with a significant number of applications including those in engineering, architecture, public health, environmental science, and business. GIS data will be created through a variety of methods including those offered by global positioning system (GPS) technologies. This course will assume knowledge of R and Python. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6850: NLP with Large Language Models\n\nIn recent times, Large Language Models (LLMs) have earned the attention of the world. OpenAI’s infamous generative LLM, ChatGPT, became the fastest-growing consumer application in history in only two months–and the feverish interest around LLMs continues to grow. This course is concerned with applying LLMs to natural language processing (NLP) problems in real-life settings. This is a seminar-based course, so students will spend the majority of time outside of class reading, with in-class time dedicated to presenting and discussing recent research developments in NLP. The course will begin with a review of the transformer architecture that underlies LLMs and describe its prominent role in modern NLP. Then, we will discuss modern issues using transformers, including: the training and scaling of transformer-based models, variations on the classic transformer, transfer learning in low-resource settings, model deployment, distributed systems, and more. Meta-learning, multimodal learning, and societal impact will also be covered. Students will work on applications such as cross-language information retrieval, machine translation, prompt engineering, and select tasks outside of NLP. By the end of the course, students will have mastered transformer-based models and will be poised to use them at the cutting edge of NLP practice today. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 7000: Advanced Research Methodologies (Capstone Project)\n\nThe aim of this course is to teach students advanced research methodologies in developing data science research projects as well as effective scientific writing. Topics will include the principles of research questions development, research methods selection, effective results interpretation, effective writing, appropriate journal paper writing styles, peer review, authorship, and communicating scientific ideas to academic and non-academic audiences. In addition, this course will provide guidance on paper publishing, including how to identify an appropriate journal, navigating the selection process, editing, and measuring impact. Ideal outcomes include improved self-editing, development of effective strategies for offering and receiving concise editorial recommendations among peers, and finalizing a research paper to be submitted to academic publications (e.g., journal, conference, research reports, etc.). This course specifically targets students who are interested in learning academic research practices and/or pursuing further education opportunities in a PhD program. The ideal outcome is to make a submission for academic publication, and students are encouraged to submit high-quality papers to academic journals. Although publication cannot be guaranteed, students will experience the learning process of submitting a research paper. _Prerequisites: DSAN 5000, DSAN 5100, DSAN 5300; Knowledge about data science, introductory statistics, statistical learning, and coding experience in R and/or Python._ _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n[Back to Top](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/academics/data-science-course-descriptions/elective-courses-data-science/#TOP)",

Therefore, these two DSAN graduate classes will count toward both the students’ BS (BA) and toward the MS.\n- This option **saves both time and money**, allows students to graduate with a Bachelor’s degree AND a Master of Science degree in Data Science and Analytics in 5 years (accelerated), and will advance academic and industry potential.\n- **Prerequisites**: Calc I, II, Probability & Statistics (or equivalent such as econometrics, etc.), programming R, Python, or C++ (Python is recommended). Interested students should assure completion of these classes during their undergraduate degree. There are many options for these prerequisites. For example, statistics, math stats, prob & stats, econometrics, etc. are all considered “statistics” and will meet the requirement.\n\n- **Students should apply to the _Accelerated DSAN Program_ in their junior year.** [Click here for more details on when and how to apply.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ptlfcvFxBsShcwhmbdum5tQ9F0Kw3ctFiJ1RglsJFQU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Steps for Students:**\n\n- Learn about the new program by contacting gradanalytics@georgetown.edu.\n- Plan to apply in your junior year.\n- Plan to complete the prerequisites: Calc I, II, Probability & Statistics (or equivalent), Programming/CS as noted above. There are many options for these types of classes.\n- Apply to the BS(A) – MS DSAN Program\n- After acceptance, students will then take any two (2) of the following DSAN graduate class options during their senior year from this list (DSAN 5000, 5100, 5200, 5300). Students will also engage, after their junior year, in our free and online R and Python Programming Bootcamp.\n  - Generally, the minimum required GPA for applicants is 3.5, but we consider many criteria.\n  - **We DO NOT require the GRE.**\n- Students cannot register for any DSAN classes until they apply and are accepted into the Accelerated DSAN Program.\n- Students may start the BS(A) – MS Program in Fall or Spring.\n- Once students are accepted, complete the above, and graduate with their BS(A), they will then officially become MS students in DSAN and will complete the remaining 8 required DSAN classes.\n- Timing: Students may complete the remaining DSAN requirements in 3 terms. If summer is included (per the student’s choice) they can complete the MS in one year.\n\nDetails about DSAN 5000, 5100, 5200, and 5300 can be found [here](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/program-overview/course-descriptions/#core-courses).\n\n[Check Out the Accelerated Program Info Session Slides](https://georgetown.box.com/s/ksssr0g34oh9usmj110bg2de8a6wou1w)\n\n## **Further Details**\n\n**Prerequisites:** Undergraduate students who elect to apply to the Accelerated DSAN Program and who are accepted will complete the prerequisites during their undergraduate degree.\n\n1. In some cases, such as Math, Statistics, CS, and Economics, such prerequisites are likely part of the standard program. However, for other programs, such as Biology, students will need to specifically take these required requisite classes.\n   - There are often many options for classes. For example, Prob & Stats, Statistics, Math Stats, Econometrics, etc. are all considered “statistics.”\n2. **Counting Courses Twice – for BS(A) and for MS:** In the Accelerated Program, students are permitted to take DSAN classes that will **count twice – once toward their BS(A) and again toward the MS in DSAN.**\n   - Normally, students can take these DSAN graduate classes as general electives.\n   - However, ask your undergraduate advising dean if you have the option to take these classes as **major electives (electives toward the major) and not just general electives.** This will offer greater opportunities and flexibility.\n\n     - Math students can take DSAN 5100 instead of MATH 2140; i.e. they can count DSAN 5100 as their math elective instead of MATH 2140, but they cannot get Math credit for both courses.\n   - Once students complete their BS (or BA), **they will then officially become graduate students in the MS DSAN Program and will complete all remaining 8 courses for the MS degree.**\n   - **You CAN complete the MS in 1 year (12 months) and you can choose to start in Fall or Spring.**\n   - **You will participate in the required, free, self-directed and fully online “Programming in R and Python Bootcamp” as all MS students do. This is generally done the summer before you take DSAN 5000.**\n3. Generally, the minimum required GPA for applicants is 3.5, but we consider many criteria.\n4. **We DO NOT require the GRE.**",

Georgetown University offers several fun and exciting social opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students to enjoy. Through this article I will discuss some of my favorite study spots, food recommendations, and activities, either in or around the Georgetown campus.\n\n## **Study Spots**\n\nAs a graduate student who lives off-campus in Arlington, my all-time favorite study spot is [**_Kaldi’s Social House_**](https://www.kaldissocialhouse.net/) in Clarendon. Not only are the food and drinks delicious, but the ambiance is great for getting work done. Nearly all of the customers are there for the co-working environment. A close second would be [**_Three Whistles_**](https://www.three-whistles.com/), also in Clarendon.\n\nIf you’re looking for a quieter study space, the [**_Graduate Student Lounges_**](https://grad.georgetown.edu/student-life/grad-study-lounge/) on the 2nd and 4th floor of Car Barn (room 220 and 410)  is great for getting work done before/after class.\n\n## **Georgetown Orgs/Events**\n\nAs a graduate student there are still plenty of ways to be involved on campus. The McDonough School of Business offers over 40 [**_student-led graduate clubs_**](https://msb.georgetown.edu/mba/student-organizations/), ranging from academic to special interest. Most, if not all, of these clubs are NOT exclusive to MSB students. I personally have joined a few of them as a student in GSAS!\n\n[**_GradGov_**](https://gradgov.georgetown.edu/) is the student representation group for graduate students. They do elections each year for new representatives from each academic degree program. GradGov also puts on events for students, such as their annual [**_GradGov Gala_**](https://thehoya.com/news/inaugural-gradgov-gala-gathers-over-1000-attendees/), which takes place in a beautiful off-campus banquet hall and is a formal event for all graduate students (and their +1s!).\n\nThe [**_Georgetown Programming Board_**](https://www.instagram.com/gtownpb?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) offers fun and affordable events for students throughout the year, including movie night, casino night, free food, battle of the bands, and more! I would highly recommend following them on [**_Instagram_**](https://www.instagram.com/gtownpb?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) to keep up with any upcoming events.\n\nThere is also a new student-led group started by DSAN students called GU Women in Data with **membership open to all female-identifying grad students** interested in pursuing or advancing careers in the data science field. We will focus on events (brown-bag sessions, career-focused events), women-centered social gatherings, and collaborative study sessions throughout the semester. You can follow them on _[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/georgetown_women_in_data/)_ and _[sign up for their listserv](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8wCBXwfmC7ox16TM5Hq4BjvEn7_BlprJVIMDyrRiY6j8ylQ/viewform)_ to stay up to date!\n\nOne of my favorite Georgetown events is the [**_GU Farmers Market_**](https://www.gufarmersmarket.org/). This takes place in the Red Square where they have a variety of local food vendors. Follow them on [**_Instagram_**](https://www.instagram.com/gtownpb?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) to stay informed of their schedule!\n\n## **Food Recs**\n\n[**_Yellow_**](https://www.yellowthecafe.com/) is an outstanding Levantine cafe, with a menu spanning from craft coffee, tea, pitas, pastries, pizza, and softserve. It was even featured on Netflix’s show, ‘Somebody Feed Phil’.\n\n[**_Falafel Inc_**](https://www.falafelinc.org/#menu) is an extremely affordable, but still delicious, takeout spot in the heart of Georgetown. You can get a meal as low as $4!\n\n[**_Good Stuff Eatery_**](https://goodstuffeatery.com/locations/georgetown) offers farm-fresh ingredients and delicious burgers and fries. It’s one of my favorite burger spots in the area (I prefer it over 7th Street Burger!).\n\n[**_Call Your Mother_**](https://www.callyourmotherdeli.com/) is a DMV classic for great bagels (if you’re from Jersey or New York, take this with a grain of salt). My favorite is their Sun City bagel with Pastrami!\n\nThese are just a few of my favorite things to do and places to go around campus. There is so much to explore in the DMV area and I hope this list helps you get started!",

    "markdown": "![Decorative Image](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2025/03/Katie-Mead-ML-Clustering-Article-Hero.png)\n\n[Blog Posts](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/blog-posts/)\n\n# Machine Learning for Real Life: Clustering to Save Time\n\n![Katie Mead Blog Header](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2025/03/Blog-Headers-Katie.png)\n\nMachine learning can seem like something reserved for large companies and cutting-edge AI projects, but I recently used it in a simple, practical way that saved me hours of manual effort. This situation came about organically (I promise!). When I was learning about machine learning algorithms the first time, I would have appreciated more realistic and approachable use cases which I hope to show here. I want to share how I applied clustering—an often-overlooked technique—to solve a real-world problem.\n\nAs someone who’s interested in AI/ML, I’ve seen countless examples of how large companies use machine learning to optimize supply chains, improve recommendations, or detect fraud. Those examples are impressive, but I also want to understand how these techniques can be useful in my day-to-day work.\n\n## The Task\n\nI had a large number of documents to organize for another team to ultimately deliver insights. There were a few complications to this task that made it less “clean”:\n\n- I had **little contextual information** about the documents.\n- There was **no metadata** (no authors, no labels, nothing).\n- I only had the **raw content** of the documents.\n- I needed a way to make sense of them so I could ask more informed questions of the team that had the expertise.\n\nManually reading and sorting these documents was not going to be possible in the timeframe I had, so I turned to machine learning.\n\n## A Quick Primer on Clustering\n\nI ended up using **unsupervised learning** for this task, which is an area of ML that I believes deserves much more attention. In unsupervised learning, instead of training a model with labeled examples, the algorithm identifies patterns on its own.\n\n**Clustering** is a powerful technique in this category. As the name suggests, it groups similar data points together. This is powerful because instead of manually labeling or sorting data, you let the algorithm surface structure in the data for you.\n\n## How I Used Clustering to Solve My Problem\n\nI used clustering to categorize my documents into meaningful groups, which allowed me to approach subject matter experts with **organized** questions rather than a chaotic pile of text.\n\n1. **Vectorizing the documents** – Since machine learning models don’t understand raw text, I first converted each document into a numerical format that represents its meaning. It took me a single line of code (for those interested, I used [scikitlearn’s Tfidf vectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html)).\n2. **Applying clustering algorithms** – I tested a few approaches and found that a combination of [**DBSCAN**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html) (a clustering algorithm focused on finding dense regions of data and expanding outward) and [**K-means**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means) (good for forming distinct clusters) worked best for grouping my documents into meaningful categories. It had been a minute since I studied these algorithms in depth, so I will caveat that my choices were _not_ very scientific. I was looking for quick and, to the eye, meaningful grouping of data, so I was not as concerned about using the “best” approach for this particular dataset.\n3. **Tuning parameters** – Like any ML approach, clustering is not perfect out of the box. I adjusted hyperparameters (settings that influence how the model groups data) to improve the results.\n\n## Big Picture\n\nSituations like this one, where we are faced with a deluge of information, is the reason why the profession of data science now exists.\n\nI didn’t need a massive dataset or a deep learning model—just the right approach to get more clarity on my problem. Instead of blindly asking for help, I could say, “These documents seem to fall into five main categories—does that align with what you’d expect?” That small shift made a huge difference.",

Dr. Purna Gamage, Dr. James Hickman, Dr. Jeff Jacobs, and Dr. Abhijit Dasgupta took time out of their busy schedules to share invaluable insights on applications and job searching.\n\nThe day kicked off with a resume-building session led by Dr. Gamage and Dr. Hickman. Dr. Gamage introduced tools like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and how to tailor resumes for specific job descriptions, while Dr. Hickman covered the essentials of resumes and cover letters, sharing personal tips for highlighting key traits of high performers.\n\nNext, we broke into groups for technical and behavioral interview practice. Dr. Hickman and Dr. Dasgupta led technical sessions, providing real-world coding and conceptual problems for us to solve independently before discussing as a group. Their guidance on tackling technical challenges under pressure was incredibly helpful.\n\nOn the behavioral side, Dr. Gamage, Dr. Jacobs, and Dr. Dasgupta conducted mock interviews, offering feedback on how to respond to tough questions. Switching between technical and behavioral practice midway through the session allowed everyone to experience both aspects of the interview process. Each professor’s insight was nothing short of impressive.\n\nThe day wrapped up with an elevator pitch workshop led by Dr. Dasgupta. He gave helpful advice, emphasized the importance of a memorable pitch, and gave us time to craft and practice our own in small groups. Many students, along with myself, left feeling more confident in their ability to pitch themselves effectively.\n\nI could list all the resources and tips I gained from the event, but there are too many, and honestly, you’d benefit more from attending the next one yourself! DSAN offers so many opportunities to help us succeed—make sure you take advantage before it’s too late!",

However, it’s an essential skill that can significantly impact your career trajectory, opening doors to opportunities, mentorship, and valuable insights. With the right approach and mindset, even those new to the field can successfully navigate networking and build meaningful relationships that will benefit them throughout their careers.\n\n### **Career Opportunities**\n\n- _**Job referrals:**_ Knowing someone in the industry can increase your chances of getting a job, as applicants with referrals are typically moved to the top of the list.\n- _**Mentorship:**_ Networking can lead to mentorship and guidance from experienced professionals who can help you navigate your career path as well as introduce you to other like-minded professionals.\n\n### **Knowledge and Skill Development**\n\n- _**Access to resources:**_ Networking can help you discover resources to further enhance your skill set, such as training programs, workshops, or books.\n- _**Learning from others:**_ Networking is a great opportunity to learn about different career paths. You can get a sense of the day-to-day responsibilities for different job titles and see how that aligns with your personal goals and skill set. It is also a chance to understand where you may have knowledge gaps and what you can do to best prepare yourself for success within that role down the line.\n\n### **Personal Brand and Visibility**\n\n- _**Building your reputation:**_ Regularly engaging in professional circles helps establish presence and build a reputation as a knowledgeable and reliable individual. Especially when you are currently an employee of a company, getting to know your coworkers is a great way to get your name and face out there. Building these relationships early on is important for performance review, team compatibility, and  future career opportunities.\n\n### **Long-Term Relationships**\n\n- _**Personal connections:**_ Creating meaningful relationships in a professional setting can lead to friendships that will last long-term, which can be invaluable in your career.",

Since I graduated over the summer, I have had so much time on my hands! But I did switch jobs earlier this year, so it was interesting to work, do school and look for a job on the side.\n\n## **How did you manage balancing school, working full-time, and looking for a job?**\n\nFor the most part, it was just buckling down and doing it. The way that my sister likes to describe it is “Looking for a new job is a job in itself.” It takes a lot of effort and a lot more time than I think most people realize. Especially with data science in particular. I think a lot of big tech companies have the best idea of what a data scientist can do, so I think their job descriptions are probably much more accurate to what we like to do. But if you’re looking anywhere outside of the tech industry, the job description for data scientists can range anywhere from data entry to reporting to data and engineering. And that’s if you just search for “data scientist” in the job title.\n\nThe reverse also holds; some companies think they want a data engineer, but the job description actually describes a data scientist. So it’s a lot more work, I think, to find what we want. Then it’s just a numbers game and having a spreadsheet for all the applications and follow-up. It’s about time management!!\n\n## **Can you share a bit about being a consultant for Deloitte?**\n\nYou enter the firm and, essentially, you are in your own separate job market within Deloitte. Then you try and find projects in which they have a role that kind of lends itself to your skill set. It’s like applying for a job, casting a wide net. Right now with my client, I am currently fulfilling a data engineer role. So a lot of it is maintaining pipelines and doing some automation and just doing production work, processing data, and moving them along. Then publishing them for downstream stakeholders and helping to maintain some relationships with other third-party vendors that we’re working with.\n\n## **What made you decide to pursue data, science, and analytics as a career path?**\n\nMy background is in applied math, and I didn’t quite know what it is that I wanted to do with it. A lot of people say, “Wow! Math is so flexible you can do so many things”, and that’s kind of my downfall because I prefer structure. So I was sort of just applying for any job, and I landed at an IT consulting firm, where the client was Fannie Mae. It was for reporting and analytics/business intelligence role, which to me was a good starting point. It felt very adjacent to what I thought I wanted to do and would be a good pivotal point should I want to shift my focus. I was able to have hands-on experience with data. I was able to kind of get a feel for it, and after maybe three to four years of getting a lot of experience with that, in addition to working with a lot of internal customers taking on different data requests, I had a very good sense of big data, relational databases and how to interact with clients and internal customers. But I kept feeling that I didn’t just want to create what people asked for, I wanted to do something more with the data. Eventually,  we had a couple of financial modelers join our team. I thought, “Hmm. You know they’re using a bit more math than I use day to day. And so I’m just curious as to what they do.” It was from asking them questions and seeing their day-to-day work that made me think this was a natural progression for me.\n\n## **Why did you choose the DSAN program?**\n\nA lot of data science programs veer off into a big concentration on application to business,I like the fact that DSAN has a core half of your curriculum and the other half you can pick and choose what you want to do, and I also liked the fact that classes are in person.\n\n## **How did it feel coming into the program after working for several years?**\n\nI don’t think I was really coming into the program with the mindset of, “Okay, I’ll go into the program, and then I’ll just shift careers entirely just to be a data scientist”. I came into the program thinking, “Okay, I have a lot of stuff already in my toolbox. This degree will add a whole lot more to my toolbox. And now I can just go out in the world with the bigger toolbox and be able to kind of do whatever it is that I want to do”.\n\nI came to that realization because with my previous employer my responsibility was just data reporting, but I was doing so much more than just that. So I knew that being a data scientist doesn’t mean I’m just going to do data science. I have a slew of other things that come with doing a data job. My perspective was that the degree. and all the knowledge that I got from the program, was a way to help round me out even more and just help me be more flexible in terms of what I can and want to do with data.\n\n## **And you felt that a master’s degree was more beneficial for you than a boot camp?**\n\nYes. I had a conversation with a director in the office of my previous employer, and asked him if he had the choice of hiring someone with a degree vs a certification what would he choose. He said that the degree is better. He shared that a certification tells him that you know the lines of code to write and you learn to push the right buttons, but you don’t know what’s happening and why. You don’t know why you’re pushing the buttons.\n\nI actually had the chance to do a bootcamp at my previous employer. I wrote the code, I followed along, and I checked the boxes, but at the end of the day, I didn’t really know how to fine-tune it. I could read thousands of pages of documentation, but I didn’t quite know truly what was going on. I thought a program where I have the environment to ask questions, the environment to mess up, and the environment of all the information being presented to me would probably be in my best interest.\n\n## **Did you find that there was any career guidance that you got when you were in the program that helped? And did you find yourself helping others since you had already been out in the workforce?**\n\nIt really helped that a lot of professors had work experience in the field. Their teaching style and the way they communicated just resonated with me. I also shared with my fellow students that visualization and communication are important. A good thirty percent of your job can be communicating outward to your manager, to higher-ups, communicating the technical speak, and then synthesizing it to what they care about. We like the data to speak for itself, we like specificity, but at the end of the day, it’s communicating it, the narrative, the storyline, and then the impact of that.\n\n## **What was your favorite DSAN class(es)? Why?**\n\nI loved all the core courses because they allowed me to establish relationships with my cohort. As a part-time student, I wasn’t doing electives at the same time as the full-time students, so it helped me establish those relationships, especially at the height of the pandemic, and I think that was super beneficial for me.\n\nI loved all the core courses because they allowed me to establish relationships with my cohort. As a part-time student, I wasn’t doing electives at the same time as the full-time students, so it helped me establish those relationships, especially at the height of the pandemic, and I think that was super beneficial for me. So from a friend standpoint, those are my favorite classes, because I got to work with them, and see the creativity that came out of them from a purely academic standpoint.\n\n[Advanced Data Visualization (5200)](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/program-overview/course-descriptions/#dsan-5200) was the most fun for me because it was more portfolio based. Since I was a part-time student and not looking for a job, I ended up kind of picking myself as a topic. I did visualizations on things I love to do, watch, and topical things at the time. The Neural Networks and Deep Learning class was also very interesting to me from a technical standpoint because it was so far from what I already knew when I entered the program and was an exciting topic.\n\n## **What were some of your best experiences at DSAN, both inside or outside of the classroom?**\n\nFor me, the moments that stuck out the most were fostering those connections that I made with my classmates, anywhere from meeting up with them at the height of the pandemic and just trying to figure out how to make our final project presentation and collaborating to finally being in person.\n\n## **What are you reading/watching/playing/listening to/learning right now?**\n\nPre-pandemic my hobby was cooking. I love cooking because it’s very forgiving but I was always scared of baking. Baking is a science and if you mess up you’ve burned the house down!! But before the pandemic, I started baking, and while I haven’t really baked too much after the pandemic, I’m thinking about picking that up again. I’m also watching Survivor.  I’m one of those people that can work with stuff in the background. So earlier this spring I started season one in the background while I was working, and right now I am in the middle of season thirty-one! I also watch anime. Right now I’m mostly keeping up with the popular ones like Spy x Family and Bleach.",

Healy Hall and Healy Lawn are behind her.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/11/11.png)\n\n**DSAN ’22**\n\n_Data Scientist at Sony Pictures Entertainment_\n\n* * *\n\n## **How has acquiring your master’s degree impacted your career journey?**\n\nThroughout the master’s program, I was working full-time and took classes part-time. I wanted to accelerate my career once I graduated and gained a solid foundation. I graduated in May 2022 and started applying for jobs with the technical opportunities I was looking for. The past three years at Georgetown provided me with the leveraged ability to gain so much knowledge and experience which I would not have been able to do outside of the classroom.\n\n## **What inspired you to pursue a career in data science and analytics?**\n\nI studied mathematics in my undergrad and have always loved logical thinking. I find data science and analytics to be the perfect balance of logic and creativity. On top of that, data is everywhere! Data science can be used in any professional field, which is awesome for job opportunities.\n\n## **Why did you choose the DSAN program?**\n\nI chose the DSAN program because of its flexibility and faculty. I was working full-time and seeking a program where I could continue working while I studied. Georgetown’s DSAN program let me work during the day and take night classes part-time. The other aspect that I loved was the in-person classes. I didn’t want to complete a degree online; I wanted to feel the community and build relationships with faculty and classmates. Needless to say, it was the best choice!\n\n## **What were some of your best experiences in the program, both inside and outside the classroom?**\n\nThe projects, labs, and relationships I’ve made. Inside the classroom, the projects and labs were so helpful. Everything we’ve built and worked on was all from “real-world” data sources and important topics. It was great to be able to continuously build a portfolio of past work.\n\nThe relationships I’ve made with the faculty and my classmates have been priceless and there has been so much support from classwork and networking.\n\n## **What was your favorite DSAN course at Georgetown? Why?**\n\nThis is a hard question! If I HAD to pick, I’d say Massive Data Fundamentals because it provides you with tools/skills that are so imperative in Data Science. There is loads of data out there! Most models have to be trained in the cloud. Not to mention, the instructor is fantastic and super helpful.\n\n## **How have you found support as a woman in tech?**\n\nStarting out in data science was a little shaky for me. I had no friends in this field and no network, but within this program, I ended up finding so much support that branched out. From my classmates to the faculty, I’ve never lacked guidance. Even during the pandemic, there was always support and encouragement to work hard and gain experience. I am so thankful for my time at Georgetown.\n\n## **What are you reading/watching/playing/listening to/learning right now?**\n\nI’m undeniably an avid book nerd and have a few currently in rotation. They are – _Just Kids_ by Patti Smith, _Jamaica Inn_ by Daphne DuMaurier, and _Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic_ by Tom Holland (not Spiderman). I am also thrilled about the two new Red Hot Chili Pepper albums that came out this year, so that’s what I’ve been listening to (especially while I code).",

    "markdown": "# International Students\n\n## Admissions\n\nThe Office of Global Services (OGS) only processes immigration documents for international students who are fully admitted to Georgetown University. The immigration document request process starts in mid-March for students entering their program in the Fall. New students should carefully follow instructions in their admission letter to request an immigration document.\n\nNOTE: The F-1 or J-1 immigration process to obtain a visa begins only after a student is fully admitted and has confirmed enrollment.\n\nApplicants who attended institutions outside of the United States must submit their transcripts in the form of a course-by-course evaluation using a credential evaluation service that is a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services ( [NACES](https://www.naces.org/)), such as [WES](https://www.wes.org/credential-evaluations/) ICAP or [SpanTran](https://spanside.my.salesforce-sites.com/SpantranApplication?Id=53cc707f-94b3-4a1a-9cdc-3a26e6742adf) Course Analysis. (These evaluations are not a requirement of all programs in the Graduate School, but are required for the Data Science & Analytics Program. **No exceptions will be made.**)\n\nYou will not need to send your transcript evaluation to our school at this time; instead, you should ask the evaluation service to send the evaluation directly to you, and then you should upload the evaluation directly to the online application. An official transcript will be required if you are offered admission to the program.\n\nApplicants may use other credential evaluation services that are members of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES) but must still submit official transcripts from the institution to Georgetown if the evaluation does not include an official copy of the transcripts you had evaluated.\n\n> I chose Georgetown because I thought it would cover deeper aspects of data science, and my experience has reflected that. I’m encouraged to think about the “whys” behind what we are doing with statistics, algorithms, and computation to extrapolate to different data science situations.”\n>\n> **Aeint Thet Ngon, DSAN’18** – **Data Analyst, Rockstar Games**\n\n## TOEFL Requirements for Non-Native Speakers of English\n\n- Applicants who have not attended an institution of higher education where the primary language of instruction is English and who are not native speakers are also required to demonstrate proficiency in the English language. Non-native speakers must achieve at least a minimum score on either the TOEFL or IELTS.\n  - [TOEFL](http://www.toefl.org/): A minimum score of 100 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).\n  - [IELTS](http://www.ielts.org/): A minimum score of 7.5 from the International English Language Testing System (IELTS).\n- Test scores should be received by the application deadline date. Applicants should allow six to eight weeks from the test date for the reporting of scores. If you are a non-native speaker of English and received a bachelor’s or advanced degree from an accredited institution of higher education where English is the primary language of instruction, you do not have to submit TOEFL or IELTS scores.\n- Georgetown University’s institution code for reporting TOEFL scores is 5244.\n\n## Agenda from Admission to Enrollment\n\n- Gather [required documentation](https://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/students/new-students/required-documents/) for Georgetown Form I-20 or Form DS-2019 Issuance.\n- After receiving the Georgetown Form I-20 or Form DS-2019 students are ready to [apply for the F-1 or J-1 visa,](https://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/students/new-students/visa/)\n- Finalize [travel arrangements](https://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/students/new-students/visa/#c_cb63bb7f91f4).\n- [Plan arrival at Georgetown.](https://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/students/new-students/visa/#c_adf58047b573)\n- Attend the [International Graduate Student Orientation](https://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/students/new-students/orientation/#_ga=2.174764706.1239715907.1697138151-1641138770.1682710473)\n\n## International Student Resources\n\nThe Georgetown Office of Global Services has a [detailed resource guide](https://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/students/new-students/#_ga=2.153280184.1239715907.1697138151-1641138770.1682710473) to help you navigate your journey to Georgetown.\n\n**\\*** The CIP code for this program is 30.3001 – **this program is STEM-eligible**.",

    "markdown": "![Campus from the Key Bridge](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/05/Student-Profile-Header.png)\n\n[News Story](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/news-story/)[Student Profile](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/announcements/student-profile/)\n\n# Tereza Martinkova\n\n![Headshot of Tereza Martinkova](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/04/35.png)\n\n_Tereza’s (MS’24) warmth and kindness are an integral part of why she excels as a DSAN Teaching Assistant and an active member of the DSAN community!_\n\n## Why did you choose the DSAN program at GU?\n\nThe DSAN program at GU was a good match for me in several aspects. Washington, D.C. was already my number one choice location-wise, but in terms of the program itself, I was looking for something that would offer a good transition from just graduating college to entering graduate school, which the DSAN program was one of the few to provide. Additionally, as a Business and Economics major in college, I was looking for programs that would offer classes focusing on those aspects too. I was excited that the program director was teaching the Applied Time Series class, which was one of the classes I was most looking forward to. As part of my research for graduate schools, I looked up the publications of the full-time professors in the program, and specifically, Dr. Gamage’s paper topics were something I was interested in, which only supported my decision to apply to the DSAN program. Finally, looking at the core classes and electives, all of them seemed very intriguing and like something I would want to learn more about.\n\n## Who had the greatest influence on your career path/education path?\n\nMy parents have supported me throughout my entire educational journey by encouraging me to challenge myself and having my back no matter what. But when I was a junior in college, I started to figure out which career path was right for me, and data science wasn’t something I thought of immediately, mainly because I didn’t know much about it. One day, I was talking to a family friend about which programs to apply to for graduate school, and I was focusing on business analytics. His response was, “I thought you liked coding, why don’t you apply to data science programs instead?” and that was the first time I started thinking about and researching it. I don’t think I would have gotten into data science without having this conversation and I am so grateful for it.\n\n## What do you find most rewarding about being a Graduate Teaching Assistant?\n\nFor both of the classes where I was a graduate teaching assistant, I had taken the classes in the previous semester. Knowing what parts I found challenging or felt needed improvement helped a lot in understanding how to approach those issues. For example, in my Time Series class, there was one homework assignment that was significantly longer and more challenging than the others. Therefore, I made sure to provide additional instructions and advised the students to set aside more time for that specific assignment to ensure they didn’t struggle like I did. Many of the projects the students are working on are a passion for them, and it is extremely rewarding to see their projects become very complex and successful with the help I was able to provide.\n\n## What is your favorite class in the DSAN program?\n\nMy absolute favorite class in this program is the Computer Linguistics class. Professor Trevor Adriaanse has prepared a very intriguing syllabus that, combined with his talent for lecturing, makes the class not only interesting but also captivating. It is by no means an easy class, but it is definitely one from which anyone will learn a lot. The class focuses on object-oriented programming, a very common practice in the industry, and natural language processing, which is widely used among data scientists. Professor Trevor ensures that everyone understands all the concepts in every lecture and that the students are capable of applying them in their own projects. The final project of this class involves coding and presenting software that we developed in groups. This is an amazing learning experience because we learn how to program our part of the task in a way that the rest of the team can understand, we learn how to communicate in a team where people might have different approaches to coding, how to design software well, and last but not least, how to present our ideas to the rest of the class in a captivating manner.\n\n## Any advice you’d give prospective students?\n\n- Putting in the hard work pays off.\n- Never be too shy to ask for help.\n- Study groups are great for all kinds of support.\n\n## What would people be surprised to learn about you?\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/04/36.png)\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/04/37.png)\n\nI used to compete in downhill skiing and have been windsurfing since I was 7 years old. These are also the two activities I engage in during the breaks between semesters. They always give me so much energy and motivation to work hard through the upcoming semester! Also, I got to go skiing with some of the other DSAN students recently, and it was so much fun! For some, this was their first time skiing, and they did absolutely amazing!\n\n## You’re graduating in May (2024)! What was your favorite DSAN experience?\n\nMy favorite DSAN experience was either the DataKind Hackathon or one of the game nights. I really enjoyed the DataKind Hackathon because I got to work with many different people from the industry, and we had an amazing team leader, Amelia Baier. We worked with a non-profit organization called Rise Boro to help them optimize their delivery route. We got to discover new Python libraries, such as GeoPy’s Photon, for mapping. The DSAN game nights are a lot of fun as well. I don’t think you get to see people try to enact ‘descending gradient’ as part of Fishbowl anywhere else. Besides that, it is a great chance to get to know people with whom you might have had no classes or you hadn’t had the chance to talk to before.\n\n## If you could have any superpower what would it be, and why?\n\nIf I could have any superpower, it would definitely be to teleport. I love to travel, and there is so much I would love to see not only in the US but also around the world. My top destination on my travel bucket list right now is Singapore, but finding the time to go might be challenging. So, teleportation all the way!\n\n[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-BSC82Y20RS&gacid=1466507451.1743608672&gtm=45je53v1v9104488821z877583222za200zb77583222&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=102788824~102803279~102813109~102887799~102926062~102975949~102976415&z=1562777161)[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-PMZB7WHYPX&gacid=1466507451.1743608672&gtm=45je53v1v9104793239z877583222za200zb77583222&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=102509683~102788824~102803279~102813109~102887800~102926062~102975949~102976415~103016951&z=630549646)[iframe](https://14950278.fls.doubleclick.net/activityi;src=14950278;type=anlytcal;cat=anlytcal;ord=5768329265004;npa=0;auiddc=847185083.1743608671;ps=1;pcor=886820207;uaa=x86;uab=64;uafvl=Chromium%3B134.0.6998.165%7CNot%253AA-Brand%3B24.0.0.0%7CGoogle%2520Chrome%3B134.0.6998.165;uamb=0;uam=;uap=Linux%20x86_64;uapv=6.6.72;uaw=0;pscdl=noapi;frm=0;_tu=KlA;gtm=45fe53v1v9198042436z877583222za201zb9104793239;gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1;dma=0;dc_fmt=1;tag_exp=102788824~102803279~102813109~102887799~102926062~102975949~102976415;epver=2;~oref=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.georgetown.edu%2Fannouncements%2Fstudent-profile%2Ftereza-martinkova%2F?)[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/fls/rul/activityi;fledge=1;src=14950278;type=anlytcal;cat=anlytcal;ord=5768329265004;npa=0;auiddc=847185083.1743608671;ps=1;pcor=886820207;uaa=x86;uab=64;uafvl=Chromium%3B134.0.6998.165%7CNot%253AA-Brand%3B24.0.0.0%7CGoogle%2520Chrome%3B134.0.6998.165;uamb=0;uam=;uap=Linux%20x86_64;uapv=6.6.72;uaw=0;pscdl=noapi;frm=0;_tu=KlA;gtm=45fe53v1v9198042436z877583222za201zb9104793239;gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1;dma=0;dc_fmt=9;tag_exp=102788824~102803279~102813109~102887799~102926062~102975949~102976415;epver=2;~oref=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.georgetown.edu%2Fannouncements%2Fstudent-profile%2Ftereza-martinkova%2F?)\n\n![](https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=13014621&tm=gtm002&Ver=2&mid=bf84cc91-a7c8-4693-a0a8-fa2627475901&bo=1&sid=5ed0d6a00fd911f09ec255bf572d884a&vid=5ed207600fd911f094260d4cd79e85fd&vids=1&msclkid=N&pi=918639831&lg=en-US&sw=1280&sh=1024&sc=24&tl=Tereza%20Martinkova%20%7C%20Master%20of%20Science%20in%20Data%20Science%20%26%20Analytics%20%7C%20Georgetown%20University&p=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.georgetown.edu%2Fannouncements%2Fstudent-profile%2Ftereza-martinkova%2F&r=&lt=1179&evt=pageLoad&sv=1&cdb=AQAQ&rn=627652)\n\n[iframe](about:blank)[iframe](https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/up?adv=tz1xvy0&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.georgetown.edu%2Fannouncements%2Fstudent-profile%2Ftereza-martinkova%2F&upid=a8id7gz&upv=1.1.0&paapi=1)",

Most companies offer great internal mobility where you can find the job that really interests you. Utilize some of these tips if you think you are interested in moving departments internally or if you are generally interested in pivoting your career path!\n\n1. First, look through your company’s internal database or organizational structure to find people in roles/departments that you’re interested in. You can also utilize LinkedIn for this (search: Company Name, Job Title).\n2. Once you find a handful of people you’re interested in speaking with, send them (individually)  a quick email or instant message (Slack, Teams, whatever your company uses, if they have) to set up a time to discuss their role. Use this time to ask them questions about their current role, their day-to-day responsibilities, and any skills necessary for success.\n3. If you’re looking to just get to know people on your team, set up ‘coffee chats’ where you can meet (in person in the office or virtually) to have an informal chat and get to know each other. You can discuss personal life and hobbies or center the conversation around career and the company. Having your name and face known on your team and around the company will help significantly for team morale, building meaningful connections, and especially during round table discussions.\n\n### **Common Questions to Ask in an Informational Interview**\n\n- Can you tell me about your career journey/academic background?\n- What team/department are you in at \\[Company Name\\]?\n- What do you do in your current role/what are your day-to-day responsibilities?\n- Could you give me an example of a project you worked on recently?\n- What programs/tools do you use in your role?\n- How big is your team?\n- What is your favorite thing about your role/company and one thing you would change?\n- What was the interview process like for your position?\n- What’s your team culture like?\n- Do you work cross-functionally with other departments?\n- Top skills you use in your role?\n\n### **How to Master Video Informational Interviews**\n\nIf I have a virtual coffee chat with someone, I like to split my screen so one window shows my Zoom meeting and the other has a document with the list of questions I want to ask. This way, if my mind blanks, I have a list of questions to reference to keep the conversation going.\n\nYou can also use the document on the side to take notes on what they’re saying and any advice they’re giving.\n\nHere are some more tips to master your informational interview:\n\n#### **Research and Prepare**\n\n- **Know Your Contact**: Research their LinkedIn profile and recent work. This helps you ask informed questions and show genuine interest.\n- **Customize Questions**: Tailor your questions to their role and experience, focusing on their career path, challenges, and insights.\n\n#### **Test Your Tech**\n\n- **Check Your Equipment**: Ensure your camera, microphone, and internet connection are working properly.\n- **Find a Quiet Space**: Minimize background noise and distractions to maintain focus.\n\n#### **Be Professional and Engaged**\n\n- **Dress Appropriately**: Treat the chat like a formal meeting to leave a good impression.\n- **Maintain Eye Contact**: Look at the camera occasionally to simulate eye contact, but also reference your notes naturally.\n\n#### **Active Listening and Follow-Up Questions**\n\n- Listen carefully to their responses and ask follow-up questions based on what they share. This shows you’re genuinely engaged and interested.\n\n#### **Use Non-Verbal Cues**\n\n- Nod and smile to show you’re attentive and appreciative of their time and insights.\n\n#### **Respect Time**\n\n- Be mindful of the time and wrap up promptly, even if the conversation is going well. Thank them sincerely for their time and advice.\n\n#### **Send a Follow-Up Message**\n\n- After the call, send a thank-you message mentioning specific advice or insights you found valuable. This keeps the relationship positive and professional.",

I knew I wanted to deepen my technical skills, which prompted me to pursue my master’s in data science. I was looking for three attributes in a program: in-person classes, flexibility to work full-time while attending evening classes, and an engaging curriculum. Georgetown’s DSAN program checked all three of those boxes!\n\n## **What was the best career advice you received while in the DSAN program?**\n\nSome of the best pieces of career advice came from Professor Irina Vayndiner’s Digital Storytelling class. The class focused on presenting technical and complex information, such as machine learning models, to non-technical audiences like CEOs or upper management. Besides learning helpful presentation techniques, we gained invaluable career skills, ranging from professional email writing to navigating workplace disagreements.\n\n## **Do you have any advice for current/prospective DSAN students?**\n\nApproach new courses or experiences with an open mind. Don’t hesitate to explore topics that interest you. Sometimes, preconceived notions about course difficulty or engagement can be misleading. Trust your instincts and pursue courses that intrigue you.\n\n## **How did you manage your time while pursuing your MS and working full-time at MITRE?**\n\nEffective time management was essential while balancing full-time work and pursuing my master’s in the DSAN program. I utilized evenings, weekends, and even lunch breaks at work to complete assignments. While it was difficult, working full-time did have its advantages, as I was constantly immersed in coding and the data science mindset, often completing assignments quicker while also finding concepts applicable to my work at MITRE.\n\n## **What advice would you give to someone considering the DSAN program?**\n\nResearch the professors in the DSAN program. Are their backgrounds aligned with your interests? Professors not only teach the curriculum but also contribute to your professional network. I found the courses to become more enriching when I resonated with the professor’s experiences and insights.\n\n## **What were some of your best experiences at Georgetown, both inside and/or outside of the classroom?**\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/03/002.jpg)\n\nIn addition to the great coursework in the DSAN program, I had the opportunity to participate in Georgetown’s Massive Data Institute Scholars program, which allows students to pursue data science research in various public policy-related areas. I was able to spend a semester working under a group at Georgetown Law looking into evictions in the United States. I was able to apply the skills I had been learning in the DSAN program to this new problem set providing the team with new insights. At the end of the research program, we had a showcase where we presented our work to the larger group and it was a great opportunity to supplement my DSAN studies with research.\n\nOutside the classroom, some of my favorite memories were those spent with my friends and classmates.\n\n## **What was your favorite project that you worked on?**\n\nMy favorite project was the final assignment my two classmates and I collaborated on for our natural language processing course. We adopted a distinctive approach, shifting our focus from merely fitting a machine learning model to the data at hand to questioning the necessity of solving the problem altogether. Specifically, we explored the potential of using social media as a predictor of short-term election outcomes, with the Georgia gubernatorial election at the time serving as our case study. A question we were asked was whether social media data had enough of a signal to model actual election results. After careful consideration, we determined the problem was indeed worth addressing and proceeded with a topic-modeling approach to extract insights. This methodology pushed us to delve deeper into problem-solving, closely resembling real-world challenges encountered in professional settings.\n\n## **If you could have any superpower what would it be, and why?**\n\nI think flying would be pretty cool! There are a lot of places I’d like to travel to around the world and flying would make it pretty easy to explore these new areas!",

He is wearing glasses and a plaid shirt.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/11/15.png)\n\nMS ’20\n\nSenior Data Scientist at MITRE\n\n* * *\n\n## **What inspired you to pursue a career in data science and analytics?**\n\nAs an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I spent a lot of time figuring out what I wanted to pursue as a major. I came into college expecting to be an environmental science major but quickly realized it was not for me, I then shifted to Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, then Actuarial Sciences, and then Mathematics, ultimately realizing that what I loved the most was making meaning from numbers across all subject areas. Eventually, this led me to a statistics major. And what is modern-day statistics applied to big data… Data Science!\n\n## **How did you find yourself focusing on using data to help create a safer world?**\n\nGrowing up so close to Washington DC “social good”, “security” and “government” were pretty much household terms. When I heard about all the great data-related work various non-profits were doing foreign and domestic, I knew that I wanted to leverage what I learned in the Data Science & Analytics programs at Georgetown in those areas. Whether it be sampling data to create food wastage mitigation programs or leveraging network analytics to reveal potentially nefarious entities, social/societal impact means the most to me.\n\n## **What has your career journey looked like since you graduated?**\n\nShortly after graduation, I started working as an Associate Data Scientist with the MITRE Corporation in the Network Analytics Department, I was placed on a variety of both MITRE’s internal projects and projects for a specific Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sponsor.\n\nSoon after my one-year anniversary at MITRE, I was promoted to Intermediate Data Scientist – Network Analysis & Control within my department. I was also given the opportunity to present at various Technical Exchange meetings for projects that I was now doing for a variety of different government agencies. And in January 2022 I became a technical lead for a MITRE innovation project.\n\nStarting in the fall 2022 semester, I will be an Adjunct Professor for DSAN’s Analytics 511 course (Probabilistic Modeling & Statistical Computing) in addition to continuing my work at MITRE.\n\n## **What was the best career advice you received while in the DSAN program?**\n\nProbably a tie between “start early” and “leverage LinkedIn”. Starting early gave me peace of mind that I was doing everything I could to secure a job after graduation. Although expensive, I personally found value in LinkedIn Premium because of its applicant comparison analytics and application viewing priority.\n\n## **How do you use what you learned in the DSAN program at work?**\n\nPart of my day is spent coding and part of my day is spent reporting/presenting. Aside from leveraging machine learning and big data analytics on a day-to-day basis, I simply work to code efficiently, in conjunction with presenting and visualizing the findings of advanced analysis in a way that sponsors/stakeholders can understand and help solve problems for a safer world.\n\nTechnically, in my first year working I leveraged data visualization of massive data, analysis of open-source intelligence (OSINT), and natural language processing (NLP). In the past year, my technical work included Cloud/High-Performance Computing, Spatio-Temporal Data Analytics, and Rule-based Un-supervised Machine Learning like Association Rule Mining and Correlation Analysis.\n\n## **What were some of your best experiences while in the program, both inside or outside of the classroom?**\n\nUntil the pandemic brought everything online my favorite experiences were the DCR conference hosted by Lander Analytics at Georgetown University, getting Wisemiller sandwiches between classes, and group study sessions in Lauinger library.\n\n## **What was your favorite DSAN course at Georgetown? Why?**\n\nAll the courses I took at DSAN were amazing, but my favorite course was Massive Data Fundamentals (ANLY 502). Although it was new in terms of content adding to the challenge, it was a lot of fun, and the completion of every assignment was very satisfying given all the moving parts with regard to running AWS clusters and running programs in distributed environments. I think what stuck out to me the most was the fact that the scale and processing power used in the class were very applicable to real-world data streams.\n\n## **Why did you choose the DSAN program and why would you recommend it to prospective students?**\n\nI chose this program for 3 main reasons. First, this program was the only one to have separate courses for the data science areas I was most interested in coming out of undergrad: Machine Learning, Massive Data analysis/processing, and Data Visualization. Second, the DSAN program gave me to opportunity to work part-time, TA, and get involved with research affording me the ability to get the true graduate school experience. Third, having grown up in Northern Virginia, Georgetown University was always known as a world class school with a great reputation. Those three main reasons combined made this program the obvious choice!\n\n## **What are you reading/watching/playing/listening to/learning right now?**\n\nIn my free time, I like to read philosophy, play the guitar (mostly finger-style), play squash, make pizza, play with my cat, and watch The Fast and Furious movies. I cannot wait for Fast X! Recently I bought a small electronic drum set that I use to make beats and improve my rhythm.",

    "markdown": "[Student Profile](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/announcements/student-profile/)\n\n# Billy McGloin\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/12/20.png)\n\n_Billy’s (MS ’25) gracious and friendly nature shines whether he is supporting the DSAN program as a Student Ambassador or co-running a business with his sisters._\n\n* * *\n\n## **Journey to DSAN**\n\nBilly is drawn to the pragmatic problem-solving approach that math offers, finding joy in the exploration of diverse paths to solutions, rather than focusing solely on reaching the answer. This passion for mathematical exploration naturally led him to data science, where similar principles apply within the field.\n\nHe chose to attend Villanova University for his undergraduate journey, envisioning it as an environment that would foster personal growth, self-challenge, and the development of values beyond academic and career achievements. His time at Villanova led him to major in Economics and Business Analytics, where he developed a profound interest in utilizing analytics to enact impactful change. While at Villanova, Billy had the unique opportunity to start his own business along with his sisters, leveraging the shared experience as triplets attending the same university.\n\n## **The Entrepreneur**\n\nAs a sophomore at Villanova, Billy faced a common issue facing most college students: limited storage space in a small dorm room. Unable to mount anything on the walls and having limited closet space, Billy built a shelf to sit safely and securely on top of the standard-issued hutch. Voilà! He optimized his space and had a spot for his TV, printer, textbooks, and more! After seeing how well the shelf worked, Billy’s sisters requested a shelf for their rooms and then friends started asking where they got it from. With guidance from Villanova professors and the university’s Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Billy and his sisters formed Top Shelf Designs, LLC, a retail business that helps college students maximize their space with handcrafted shelving units.\n\n“Being an entrepreneur has been a transformative journey, requiring me to navigate unexpected tasks like website building, patent law, and insurance procurement. From optimizing shelf construction to incorporating sustainability efforts, it has been a fulfilling experience, tackling challenges beyond my initial expectations.”\n\nThe time and project management skills he has developed as an entrepreneur have been invaluable in his experience in the DSAN program.\n\n## **Finding His Niche**\n\nDuring his undergraduate years, Billy appreciated the opportunity for self-discovery provided by Villanova’s Honors Program. The program’s thought-provoking classes prompted reflection on long-term goals, encouraging students to assess their current positions and the direction of their paths, fostering a valuable moment of introspection often overlooked in the hustle of college life.\n\nThis strong sense of self has led Billy to success in his first semester in the DSAN program. Billy recommends that new students go to office hours, introduce themselves to professors, ask questions, and don’t be afraid to ask for help.\n\n“What I enjoy about this program is the professors and the students. Everybody here really seems to like each other, they want to know how you’re doing and help each other with the work. I think that anyone coming into the program should be aware of this.”\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nBilly acknowledges that it might seem simple, but the best advice he can share is to be comfortable with yourself. “If you’re comfortable with yourself and who you are, then you’re not going to be as impacted by other people and what they think.” Billy notes that moving to the Georgetown area and living on his own has taught him to value himself, his time, and given him the freedom to do his own thing, increasing his confidence and sense of self.\n\n## **Surprising Story**\n\nThe President of Villanova University fed Billy waffles during his first semester of freshman year and the Dean of Villanova’s School of Business (VSB) captured this in a photograph!\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/12/Profile-Pics-3x4-5.png)\n\n“During Waffle Wednesday at Villanova, the Rev. Peter M. Donohue, OSA, PhD, was mingling with the freshman. I approached Fr. Peter and asked if he would take a photo of us eating waffles together so I could share it with my sisters, who also attended Villanova. To my surprise, Fr. Peter recognized me as ‘one of the triplets’ and not only agreed to the photo but had an even better suggestion. He handed my phone to the Dean of VSB and asked her to capture the moment, then proceeded to feed me waffles. It’s an experience that perfectly captured the unique and personable atmosphere at Villanova.”",

She has dark hair and his wearing a cream colored beanie and a green and black graphic-patterned sweater.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/11/2.png)\n\n**_Anam (’23) was awarded the Exceptional Masters Student Award by the Georgetown Graduate School as a first-year student in the Spring of 2022_**.\n\nAnam’s empathy and kindness inform her perspective of the world and her commitment to effecting social impact through her work.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Journey to DSAN**\n\nThe search for self-discovery was the catalyst that led Anam to DC and the DSAN program. As an undergrad, she was unsure as to what she wanted to do. She chose pre-med/biology at first, quickly realizing that it was not the direction she wanted to go. After being undecided for a time, Anam eventually decided to major in finance. It was in one of her finance classes, a statistics class, that her professor first introduced her to the fundamentals of data science, working in R-script. The experience led Anam to take classes in computer science and business technology, and something clicked. It was too late to pivot into a data major, but she had been bitten by the data science bug.\n\nAs she began to work in the finance sector, Anam found that she did not feel the same passion for finance and economics that her peers did. It was a time of great self-reflection for her as she worked to figure out which direction she wanted her career to take. She realized that when choosing a major at 18 or 19 years old, you don’t always have all of the information about what you will gravitate towards. As her finance career progressed, her stats professor continued to further her interest in data science; she even helped him to write a statistics textbook. When he started a data science master’s program in Florida, Anam looked inward and realized that while she wanted to pursue a master’s in the field, she wanted to strike out on her own and try somewhere new.\n\n## **Finding her Niche**\n\n“I like the way you can get the gist of a whole story based on the data. There’s a lot of data out there, and a lot of things that I feel aren’t analyzed. In one of my first projects in my first semester, we analyzed the quality of life for the queer community and the LGBTQ community. It was, surprisingly, pretty difficult to find data on that and to do any sort of actual analysis with that.” In her time here Anam has found herself inspired by the use of data storytelling as a catalyst for social impact. She is intrigued by the idea that you can create a factual story, using data, that motivates people to pay attention, to take action; that you can combine coding and data science with social change.\n\nIn affecting social impact through data storytelling, one has to be aware of inherent biases. Anam shared that many of the DSAN professors emphasize how important it is not to let your biases interfere with the story you’re telling with your data. One example she shared was when “analyzing queer life, I definitely had a lot of biases while I was doing that, and I was realizing that a lot of them were not what I thought. Because I remember doing something for analyzing just pay disparity. And in my mind, I was like, ‘oh, they’re probably getting paid less.’ It was interesting because that wasn’t really the disparity I was seeing in the data. It was more so men and women \\[with a pay disparity\\].” Anam also highlighted the distinct difference between data bias and the perspective from which you are presenting the data. “That’s why we have all these perspectives, and we have all these different kinds of people \\[in the field\\] because we don’t really want to hear the same story over and over again by the same type of person. Who you are, plays a role in the kind of data analysis that you do.”\n\n> _“Anam is an exceptional student who is intelligent and actively participates in the classroom as well as in the program. She won the Georgetown University Exceptional Master’s Student award out of many nominees from different programs. She was an amazing TA who helped students significantly and she has proven herself as a great mentor and team player. Anam is very smart and kind and I have no doubt that she will continue to make valuable contributions to any team or organization she becomes a part of.”_\n>\n> Dr. Purna Gamage, DSAN Program Director\n\n## **A Force for Change**\n\nAdvanced Data Visualization(ANLY-503) was an incredibly helpful class for Anam’s current job working part-time for a data science consulting company, Demographic Analytics Advisors, that focuses on non-profit consulting. The founder of the company is a senior fellow at MDI with whom Anam connected through a fellow DSAN student. After interning for the company over the summer, she was asked to stay on through her final year in the program. Her current work at Demographic is on a project that seeks to propose new ways to count Asian populations in the U.S. Census, as there has historically been a significant amount of error in how that particular population is reported. The hope is that this will highlight the need to investigate why this is happening and how to fix it, as it is not an issue isolated to the Asian community. The publication they will soon be releasing will have Anam’s name on it!\\`\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nWith her graduation date in May approaching, Anam finds herself excited at the prospect of forging her path. When asked what advice she would give current and future students she highlighted the importance of taking advantage of all the resources the DSAN program offers. “Your professors are super eager to help. Go to events and meet your fellow students. Finding people on the same path can be so helpful as you move through the journey of graduate school and the DSAN program. Engage with the program. This program is more than just your classes each week.”\n\n## **In Her Free Time**\n\n“I’ve gotten back into cooking, baking is a little harder, so I don’t do it as often. I cook a lot of pasta!” She enjoys cooking Pakistani food with her mom when she goes home, and she cooks the “easier” Pakistani food in her own kitchen. Her favorite Pakistani dish is Nihari, a beef stew, and paratha, a flat and flaky bread.",

I graduated from my undergraduate program in May of 2020 at the height of the pandemic. Since there weren’t many jobs available, I decided that it was the perfect time to go back to school and knock out a graduate degree. I chose data science because I excelled the most in my STEM-heavy classes during undergrad and I had friends who highly recommended the field. I chose Georgetown because, well, it’s Georgetown!\n\n## **What was the best career advice you received while in the DSAN program?**\n\nLearn as wide a variety of skills as possible. Don’t just focus on a single subject. Data Scientists are by nature Swiss Army knives who are capable of doing many things and wearing many hats. The more tools under your belt, the more useful you become.\n\n## **Do you have any advice for current/prospective DSAN students?**\n\nMy advice would be to learn as much Python and other technical skills as possible, even if it’s not what you want to do for the rest of your career. It is much, much easier for a technical person to become a manager than it is for a manager to become a technical person.\n\n## **How did you initially become interested in Machine Learning? What drives your passion for its real-world applications?**\n\nI think the more you learn about Machine Learning the less mysterious it becomes. To the rest of the world, Machine Learning is a catch-all term that’s synonymous with “magic” but to us, it’s simple concepts and a little bit of fancy math. The insider understanding of these algorithms that are starting to change the world is fascinating to me and it’s this interest that drives me to implement it in whatever situation I can.\n\n## **What advice would you give to someone considering the DSAN program?**\n\nDo it! Even if you don’t have any coding experience it is well worth it. DSAN students come from a wide variety of backgrounds and there are systems in place to help all people get as much as they can from the program.\n\n## **What were some of your best experiences at Georgetown, both inside and/or outside of the classroom?**\n\nMeeting my cohort in person after getting to know each other virtually for about a year was one of my best experiences at Georgetown. I’ve also enjoyed getting to know the professors and staff members and continuing to be a part of the DSAN community even after having graduated years ago.\n\n## **What was your favorite project that you worked on?**\n\nThere was one project where we got free access to the Twitter API and we got to fish for Tweets with all sorts of different criteria. Monitoring what the world was saying online, in real time, was a treat. We then used the Tweets to build NLP models and run unsupervised clustering methods to see what we could learn. The free API no longer exists, so it’s also interesting to think about how I was one of the last people on Earth to get access to it.\n\n## **If you could have any superpower what would it be, and why?**\n\nTeleportation. I love to travel and if I could cut plane tickets out of the cost equation I’d be able to see everything I ever wanted!",

He is wearing a navy blue suit, light blue shirt, dark red tie, and a patterned pocket square.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/11/Profile-Pics-3x4-3.png)\n\n**_Zev (’23) is one of our first BS-MS Accelerated Degree students and entered the program from the School of Foreign Service (SFS) in 2021 during his last year of earning his BSFS in International Politics._**\n\nAs a published author with a background in international politics and security and 250,000 Tik-Tok followers, this 22-year-old might just be on his way to being a renaissance man.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Journey to DSAN**\n\nZev knew in his first semester in the SFS that he wanted to take the political history and theory. He was learning and focused on making a difference in the world by solving current-day problems. The question was how.\n\nNot long after joining Georgetown for his Bachelor’s in the SFS, Zev met Dr. Kimberly Sellers, a professor and statistician in the Math and Statistics department, at a research fair. In the two years he worked with her, they often talked about Zev’s desire to interact more with actual, current data instead of historical data. Dr. Sellers wisely coaxed him into taking more math and stats classes. He found he enjoyed getting hands-on with code and, with Dr. Sellers’ encouragement and assistance, applied for the BS-MS with DSAN.\n\nThe breadth of knowledge afforded by Zev’s combined education in the SFS and now data science and analytics has given him a path forward that he is truly passionate about: Helping to build a bridge between international policy and data, especially using data to ensure that diplomatic policy is working.\n\n## **An Unexpected Turn**\n\nOne aspect of Zev’s journey was wholly unexpected: TikTok activist and creator.\n\nZev had written a book called _Two Fish in a Tank: How Jokes Can Give Hope in a Fractured World_. He was inspired by the writings of holocaust survivors, many of whom talked about how they made jokes in the camps to deal with the day-to-day horrors, and how humor is often present in even the most brutal situations as a means to cope and process. After writing his book and publishing it during the pandemic, his sister suggested that he go on TikTok to promote it. As Zev knew nothing about TikTok, it wasn’t the most successful of marketing plans. It wasn’t until he posted a short video about an obscure math summation before heading into his Russian class that he had his first brush with being a bit of a viral sensation.\n\nHe broke 5,000 followers pretty quickly but truly saw his TikTok profile blow up when he began posting on January 6, 2020. He was in DC at the time and used his platform and his SFS studies in domestic terrorism to give context and background to what was happening. As often happens, the internet was not always kind. Antisemitic vitriol rolled in. When he spoke about antisemitism, his profile blew up exponentially. He had his first million-view video. Putting it in context, Zev says, “Imagine that many people watching you speak in an auditorium.” As he progressed in the DSAN program he began to speak out about data misinformation. His dedicated following tripled to 250,000.\n\n> _Zev is an excellent student who is full of energy, enthusiasm and has great communication skills. He is always very engaging and humorous in class as well as while presenting his research findings, which I think is a great quality as I’m always keen to hear Zev presenting. He is a very talented student and I can’t wait to see his next great adventure”_\n>\n> Dr. Purna Gamage, DSAN Program Director\n\n## **Focusing on the Future**\n\nZev’s ability and passion for communicating complex ideas and topics have become integral to his success in the DSAN program. He loves how the program emphasizes the importance of data communication. He states that anyone from any school can run the models, but DSAN emphasizes the importance of being able to tell the story. “A good data scientist can connect with the general public,” he says. “Data means nothing if you can’t explain why it matters”.\n\nHis training at DSAN has given him a breadth of knowledge and a deeper world perspective. He believes the best way to learn about the world is to know the “why” behind what you are learning.",

Secondly, I wanted to hone the technical skills I’d started to develop during my undergrad degree. Lastly, I’d be allowing myself to dive deep into a field that’s super relevant in the ever-changing, digitally-driven world we live in today. This would also give me more career avenues to explore down the line.\n\n## **What is your favorite class in the DSAN program?**\n\nNetwork Analytics with Professor Hickman, without a doubt. In addition to being the first class I took as a full-time DSAN student, it was also the one that initially got me to think about how I could apply data science to ‘non-conventional’ areas after having developed my fundamentals. Even today, I use several practices I picked up during the course in my day-to-day work, leaving a lasting impact on me.\n\n## **Any advice you’d give prospective students?**\n\nA piece of advice I’d give prospective students (and something that I constantly tell myself) is to stay relentlessly curious and take advantage of everything Georgetown has to offer. We’re tremendously lucky to be backed by qualified professors, a strong alumni network, and many academic and professional opportunities.\n\nI’ve always viewed Georgetown as a place for self-discovery and for me to push myself beyond my limits. So, my second piece of advice would be to never be afraid to take that risk or step out of your comfort zone. Two years can fly by, so make every day count!\n\n![Two men in squash uniforms holding a trophy](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/05/48.png)\n\n## **What would people be surprised to learn about you?**\n\nPeople would be surprised to learn that I’m a competitive squash player, and grew up playing at the national level in India. I moved to the US to play for a boarding school in Connecticut at the age of 15 and ultimately ended up at Georgetown where I was the team captain. Some of my fondest memories at Georgetown have been created with my squash team – whether it be through bonding on away trips or struggling together during practices. The connections, skills, and experiences I’ve gained over the years have been invaluable, and also a reason why the sport has always played a huge role in my life and continues to do so today!",

    "markdown": "[Alumni Profile](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/alumni-profile/)\n\n# Brian Li\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bli99/)\n\n![Brian Li is standing facing the camera smiling and wearing his black graduation gown with a yellow hood and blue stole.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/11/18.png)\n\nMS ’23\n\nData Engineer & Senior Data Scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton\n\n* * *\n\n## **How has acquiring your master’s degree impacted your career journey?**\n\nGetting my master’s degree has cultivated a sense of confidence derived from hours of hard work and dedication. The academic rigor and breadth of the program have prepared me well as I embark on my career journey in the dynamic, fast-paced data science industry. Equally important is the network I’ve built in the process of attending various conferences, workshops, and hackathons. The collaborative environment at Georgetown, fostered by diligent peers and nurturing professors has not only boosted my academic and professional growth but has also contributed greatly to my personal growth. In the last two years, I’ve evolved into a stronger data scientist, and more importantly, a more well-rounded individual.\n\n## **What inspired you to pursue a career in data science and analytics?**\n\nMy fascination with statistics began in high school during AP Statistics, where I was intrigued by its broad applications and its role in decision-making. At that point, my higher education path still remained uncertain. However, my passion for data science truly blossomed during my college years. At Hamilton, I became one of the first to craft an interdisciplinary data science major, blending computer science, math, and statistics to align with my specific interests. Recognizing that undergraduate studies were just the tip of the iceberg, I decided to pursue a master’s in data science, and I haven’t looked back since!\n\n## **Why did you choose the DSAN program?**\n\nAfter going to college in a very small-town environment, I knew I wanted to be in an urban environment for grad school. I had visited DC in the past, and Georgetown left a mark on me because of its beauty and charm. I remember looking at the old DSAN website, and seeing how happy the students looked. Academically, I liked that there were 5 core classes and 5 electives that we could choose from. Having the option of picking electives specific to my interests was a big deciding factor for me.\n\n## **What was the best career advice you received while in the DSAN program?**\n\nThe best advice I got was pretty simple but stuck with me. It’s all about looking at the bigger picture. This is especially true in data science, but I’ve found it to be solid life advice too.\n\n## **What were some of your best experiences in the program, both inside and outside the classroom?**\n\n![A large group of students smile facing the camera, standing in a large group. Brian Li is in the top left of the image holding the camera for a selfie.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/11/Brian-Li-Profile.jpeg)\n\nThe time spent with my classmates and professors holds a special place in my heart. The past two years have been some of the happiest, largely thanks to the friendships I forged along the way. Post-graduation, what I miss most is the daily interaction with friends and peers. A special memory is the DSAN game night—a classic, carefree gathering where everyone in the program came together to enjoy each other’s company.\n\nBeyond the program, becoming a part of the vibrant DC music scene has been both enjoyable and enriching. Playing music with my friends has been a vital escape from the daily grind of crunching numbers. Working as a barista at Compass Coffee in Georgetown also added a fun element and really connected me to the community I hold dear.\n\n## **What was your favorite DSAN course at Georgetown? Why?**\n\nSelecting a favorite class is a challenge, as each one has played a role in my development as a data scientist. However, if I were to pinpoint the most memorable, it would be [Digital Storytelling](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/program-overview/course-descriptions/#dsan-5900) with [Professor Irina Vayndiner](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/0033600001LcsfBAAR/irina-vayndiner). This course fundamentally shifted my perspective on the role of data scientists. It helped me understand that the meticulous work and time invested in cleaning and summarizing data serves a larger purpose—to craft compelling narratives that resonate with the audience.\n\n## **Favorite gig your band has played?**\n\nI would have to say our first gig at Union Stage on the Wharf is my favorite! It was our first show in DC and the most memorable part was all of my friends showing love and supporting us. It was such a wholesome moment and I’ll never ever forget it! Stay tuned for new music from Melophoria dropping soon 🙂\n\n## **What are you reading/watching/playing/listening to or learning right now?**\n\nI’m really enjoying Mitski’s new album The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We, and I think it’s a soothing, warm listen to complement Fall. My favorites are tracks 3, 7, and 8. Also, lots of Peach Pit, MUNA, and Men I Trust since I got to see them live recently. I’m currently reading The Three-Body Problem, which was recommended to me by a fellow DSAN graduate. Also eagerly waiting for the new Murakami book to be translated soon!\n\n[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-BSC82Y20RS&gacid=100233696.1743608751&gtm=45je53v1v9104488821z877583222za200zb77583222&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=102525910~102788824~102803279~102813109~102887800~102926062~102975949~102976415~103016950&z=1943949370)[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-PMZB7WHYPX&gacid=100233696.1743608751&gtm=45je53v1v9104793239z877583222za200zb77583222&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=102788824~102803279~102813109~102887800~102926062~102975949~102976415&z=484307014)[iframe](https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/up?adv=tz1xvy0&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.georgetown.edu%2Falumni-profile%2Fbrian-li%2F&upid=a8id7gz&upv=1.1.0&paapi=1)\n\n![](https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=13014621&tm=gtm002&Ver=2&mid=18a68ece-7331-432b-8e3e-3d7058438728&bo=1&sid=8e8468b00fd911f0b39c4da296e43206&vid=8e8467900fd911f0ac6b656974d25929&vids=1&msclkid=N&pi=918639831&lg=en-US&sw=1280&sh=1024&sc=24&tl=Brian%20Li%20%7C%20Master%20of%20Science%20in%20Data%20Science%20%26%20Analytics%20%7C%20Georgetown%20University&p=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.georgetown.edu%2Falumni-profile%2Fbrian-li%2F&r=&lt=723&evt=pageLoad&sv=1&cdb=AQAA&rn=478424)",

This was a multidisciplinary event was a month-long hackathon centered around analyzing parking data from local lots. Initially, the original challenge encouraged participants to create front-end web applications that optimize parking spot selection, but we decided to take a different approach. When we discovered that the Application Programming Interface (API) provided for the event included historical parking data spanning an entire year, we saw an opportunity to explore broader trends.\n\nOver the course of the hackathon, we developed insights into how parking behaviors fluctuate during these times and prepared our findings for presentation at the conference. It enabled us to learn about new models and methods we could utilize on future data challenges.\n\nThere was a considerable amount of people from many different fields of work. Professionals from various fields—software engineers, entrepreneurs, data analysts, consultants, mathematicians, and DevOps specialists—were all in attendance. Specifically, we were surprised at how many people represented their own tech start-ups, and the ambition that came with that.\n\n![Trey and Sophie speak at the Code the Curb Hackathon](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/12/Coding-the-Curb-3.jpg)\n\nAfter our presentation, taking questions, and giving recommendations on how parking can be made more efficient utilizing the previous data collected from the API, a period of networking gave us the chance to talk with the others and those we hadn’t met, to discuss both our projects and our future work. During the Q&A session, we shared recommendations for improving parking efficiency by leveraging the insights gained from historical data. Many were appreciative of our initiative to forefront trend analysis rather than developing a web application. They were also excited to see technical presentations done in a manner that was both professional and fun (shoutout PowerPoint). The subsequent networking period provided a fantastic opportunity to connect with other participants and exchange ideas about future projects and collaborations. Outside of our presentation, we got to learn about how some of the other participants took on the challenge and were very intrigued by many of the creative insights!\n\nOverall, the experience was both enriching and inspiring. Events like these not only push us to think critically and creatively but also foster a sense of community among professionals from diverse backgrounds.",

    "markdown": "![Group photo of a large number of DSAN Students in the DSAN Office Suite](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2025/01/Vivi-Blog-Image-Involvment.png)\n\n[Blog Posts](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/blog-posts/)\n\n# Why Getting Involved is Important for Your Data Science Career\n\n![Viviana's Blog Header](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/10/2-2.png)\n\nExcelling as a data scientist isn’t just about mastering technical skills. Research, internships, and social or administrative roles in the Data Science and Analytics (DSAN) program can provide invaluable opportunities to specialize, develop communication skills, and expand your professional network. I can speak from personal experience–  in my first semester at DSAN, I immersed myself in three extracurricular roles, each contributing to my growth in unique ways. I’m a Professional Development Center assistant, helping students with professional growth and applications, and writing blog posts like this one you’re reading now! I am also a research assistant in Dr. Qiwei (Britt) He’s AI Measurement & Development (AIMD) lab, conducting extensive literature reviews on technical topics to support groundbreaking research. Lastly, I worked as a teaching assistant for Dr. Abhijit Dasgupta’s course DSAN 6150: Biological and Biomedical Data Science. While managing these responsibilities was challenging, it improved my efficiency and time management skills and, more importantly, underscored the value of non-technical skills in data science. If you’re a data science student or prospective applicant, you should know that the skills that can be gained from getting involved in new topics and roles are what help you stand out and find your place in the increasingly competitive world of data science.\n\n## Why You Should Get Involved\n\nEngaging in various roles and topics can help you find your niche, expand your knowledge, refine your communication skills, and develop meaningful connections—all of which are critical advantages in the data science field.\n\n### **Finding Your Niche**\n\nGetting involved in extracurriculars during your data science studies can help you refine your specific interests as well as better understand your own preferred work style, which are both important for preparing yourself for a job you enjoy in the future.\n\n- **Discovering Passions & Interests:** Exposure to diverse roles can help define the direction you want to pursue within data science, whether it’s research, teaching, government, or industry-focused work. It may also help you discover certain topics you find particularly moving, whether it may be health, business, entertainment, and more. This will help guide your applications and style in the future and throughout your studies!\n- **Understanding Your Work Style:** Experimenting with different environments helps you identify domains that resonate with your interests and strengths. It’s important to learn about yourself and what kinds of settings and teams you like. For example, you may learn that you enjoy working in smaller teams (four to six people) because that optimizes your balance of collaboration and also independence.\n\n### **Gaining Knowledge Beyond the Classroom & Connections**\n\nSome of the most valuable knowledge I’ve gained from DSAN has come from my involvement, because these opportunities allowed me to work closely with professors and discuss tips with other students. From TAing, I’ve learned many shortcuts in R from helping students with problems and seeing their code. Also, working through problems with other students and seeing their approaches has opened my eyes to new problem-solving perspectives. Furthermore, I’ve learned about internship application platforms and opportunities through my research mentor, Dr. He, and through interacting with other students in the PDC. As an overview, involvement helps you gain the following:\n\n- **Practical Learning:** Interacting with peers and mentors in various settings often provides insights on resume building, job opportunities, and industry trends that can’t be gleaned from coursework alone.\n- **Enhanced Technical Proficiency:** Learning new software or platforms can strengthen your resume and broaden your technical capabilities, making you more versatile.\n- **Networking and building meaningful connections:** Being involved on a team helps you work alongside talented individuals who can give you valuable mentorship and guidance.\n\n### **Developing Soft Skills**\n\nGetting involved in meaningful projects and extracurricular efforts also cultivates essential soft skills that are critical for success in data science. By engaging in team-based activities, you get exposed to opportunities to further develop skills like teamwork, leadership, time management, and adaptability—skills that are transferable across any domain or career path.\n\n- **Teamwork and Leadership:** Working on group projects or committees helps you understand how to effectively collaborate with diverse personalities and viewpoints. It teaches you how to motivate and guide others while being receptive to feedback and compromise. These skills are invaluable in collaborative data science environments.\n- **Communication and Presentation Skills:** Roles that require writing, teaching, or presenting enable you to clearly articulate complex ideas to diverse audiences. For example, explaining technical concepts in a research presentation to non-technical audiences are great practice for future career work.\n- **Time Management and Flexibility:** Balancing extracurricular roles with coursework pushes you to prioritize tasks effectively and adapt to changing schedules, and this strategic thinking can translate directly to managing deadlines in professional settings.\n- **Critical Thinking and Open-Mindedness:** Exposure to different projects and problem-solving approaches broadens your perspective, encouraging innovative thinking and a willingness to learn from others.\n\nIn short, extracurricular involvement not only enhances your technical foundation but also equips you with the interpersonal and organizational skills that are essential for thriving in any professional setting.\n\n## How to Get Involved\n\nThere are numerous opportunities within and outside the DSAN program to start exploring.\n\n### **Within DSAN**\n\n- **Teaching Assistant (TA):** Being a TA is a great way to refine your knowledge on a subject, or get exposure to a new topic which you were not able to study! Being able to teach someone else content helps you really internalize and know the content yourself. This involvement experience is awesome for developing confidence in your knowledge, expertise in a topic, and skills in communicating information and demonstrating technical concepts to others, all of which are qualities that are great to have in life as a data scientist.\n- **Research:** There are two main labs in partnership with DSAN– Dr. He’s AIMD lab, and the [Massive Data Institute (MDI).](https://mdi.georgetown.edu/about-mdi/) These are AMAZING opportunities for contributing to meaningful projects with data science and learning from talented and well-respected mentors. dddDoing research with a lab helps you gain domain expertise and improve your presentation skills—all while boosting your resume. Additionally, my research experience has helped me become more self-sufficient, efficient, and reliable, as I’ve had to carry my weight for the team effort and communicate my progress.\n- **Student Ambassador, Professional Development Center, Social Committee:** These roles allow you to represent the program, engage with the student body, and refine your leadership skills. Building connections and interacting closely with other students, alumni, or prospective students is a great opportunity for expanding your network and insights.\n\n### **Outside DSAN**\n\n- **Part-Time Internships and Work:** Opportunities like those listed on [Georgetown’s internship page](https://finpolicy.georgetown.edu/internships-fellowship-opportunities/) or in government agencies can provide real-world experience and exposure to industry practices. Roles in Think Tanks and Research Institutions allow you to apply data science in policy and research-focused domains, which will enhance your versatility. If you are interested in experimenting with a setting off campus, there are plenty of opportunities that can be found that will provide you with lasting knowledge and a broadened network.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nWhile technical proficiency is essential, the skills gained from extracurricular activities—specialization, communication, and networking—are what truly distinguish a great data scientist. By getting involved, you’ll not only expand your expertise but also develop a well-rounded skillset that sets you apart in the field of data science. Though it might seem intimidating to add extra work on top of an already demanding courseload, I argue that being involved actually gives me skills and structure to be more productive, efficient, and able to deploy various perspectives to tackle a problem. For example, the things I’ve learned through my research or talking to others and gaining ideas from them through my involvements have helped me in ways I didn’t expect, like choosing a final project topic that I really liked. With all this being said, please consider this blog as a message to step out of your comfort zone and explore the wealth of opportunities available to you through DSAN and the Georgetown community!",

    "markdown": "[Student Profile](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/announcements/student-profile/)\n\n# Swami Venkat\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swami-venkat/)\n- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theartloupe/)\n\n![Swami Venkat stands on the South Lawn in front of the White House wearing a dark sweater with a white collared short underneath. People are milling around behind him. ](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/11/3.png)\n\n**_Swami (’23) is in his final year of the program after completing a Senior Product Management Internship with IBM Cloud over the summer of 2022._**\n\nAs a Student Mentor for the DSAN program, Co-Director of Events for GradGov, and a writer/artist focused on community and connection, Swami personifies his commitment to giving back.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Journey to DSAN**\n\nThe spark that would guide Swami on his journey was ignited in an undergraduate interdisciplinary class in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the Vellore Institute of Technology in Tamil Nadu, India. It was fanned into flame in further classes: An AI class on how code became smart, Machine Learning, and Soft Computing. The latter was one of the most interesting courses he took, teaching how discrete math and computer science can combine to quantify approximate values, providing imprecise but usable solutions to complex computational problems. For example, you can describe red or blue…but how do you describe something that is “kind of ” blue?\n\nAs he began to look forward in his journey, Swami wanted to find a career and learning path that was future-focused and could expand upon the classes he was passionate about as an undergraduate. This search led him to data science and analytics!\n\nThe DSAN program was an ideal fit for him in several ways. Swami appreciated the balance between applied data science and math, and was familiar with Georgetown’s excellent reputation and its campus with so much to offer. The school’s location in the vibrant and diverse city of DC was the “cherry on top!”\n\n## **Finding A Community**\n\nSwami found himself feeling incredibly lucky in the experiences he had during his first year in the program. He met phenomenal people and made such wonderful connections that he wanted to give back to a community that had given him so much. He looked at his first-year experience as a student and as an individual and felt that it’s important to grow as both. “You can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect by looking back.”\n\nThis realization, along with his excellent academic record and social experience here in the program, led him to GradGov, Georgetown’s Graduate Student Government that focuses on promoting academic, professional, and social growth. After looking at the available opportunities, he applied to be the co-director of events. Georgetown has a huge graduate student population and he was keen to meet people outside the program. Ideally he wanted to give back without expectation, work with like-minded people and a diverse leadership team, and have the space to execute his vision! His event motto is to “create experiences not just events.” This was borne out in the response to his first big event of the 22/23 academic year, GradGov’s Halloween Party. International students from our program, and others, were especially excited to be there as many were celebrating the spookiest of holidays for the first time!\n\n> _” I remember the first time that Swami presented his Final Project in my class. I was in awe because he started the presentation with an utmost interesting twist in it. He and his team took a pretty boring topic and made it into something very interesting.  I was deeply impressed by his data storytelling skills. He is a great, kind and a very polite student who is actively participating in the program and always willing to provide his support. “_\n>\n> Dr. Purna Gamage, DSAN Program Director\n\n## **Art, Storytelling, and Data**\n\nDuring the Covid crisis, Swami sought to understand himself better and how he could use his passion and experience for the service and benefit of others. Coming from a very musically inclined family, he had always been interested in the arts. As he explored different forms of expression, a friend suggested he begin by blogging. Thus @theartloupe was born, an Instagram account highlighting his thoughts and experiences during his final year of undergrad. It kicked off with movie reviews but has since evolved to focus on working through different perspectives and ideas through an artistic lens. His overarching goal is to uncover the essence of the everyday and why it’s beautiful, allowing the reader to join him in looking at the world in a new light.\n\nSwami’s penchant for approaching things from a new angle has become an asset in his work and his studies. When he began his internship at IBM last summer, he found himself in a position to effect real change within the company. During his work as a Product Management Intern, he found malicious accounts that were going against cloud policies. By effectively visuzalizing the problem to his superiors, he was able to demonstrate the need to focus on banning malicious accounts. Making an impact as an intern, opening others’ eyes to a previously unseen issue, was incredibly gratifying.\n\nAs a student, his artistic background and internship experience have given him new certainty about the importance of storytelling in data science and analytics. Going forward he will seek to use his art and tech background to create compelling visuals that foster understanding and change.  “If stakeholders can understand the data and visualizations, your job as a data analyst is fulfilled.”",

This is my second year as a student ambassador, so I can be a great resource for any program related information. In my free time, I love supporting Minnesota sports teams, listening to new music, going for runs, and playing competitive Pokemon. You can find me behind the front desk of the DSAN suite if you have any questions about the program or just want to chat!\n\n* * *\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/12/11-1024x768.png)\n\n## Shanay Wadhwani\n\nI’m a first year student in the DSAN program. I grew up in Mumbai, India and studied at Hamilton College, NY. Ever since I can remember, I’ve been fascinated with computers and the ever-increasing power of the compute technology around us. This cutting edge field has so many applications which GU allows its students to access, gain experience in, and even master. It is also forever evolving and I try my best to stay abreast of new developments in the field. In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer, chess, reading Russian literature or any fiction I can get my hands on, and cooking some simple foods. I’m always happy to connect and talk data!",

She is wearing a gray sweater.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/05/8.png)\n\nParticipating in the conference and presenting my work during the roundtable session was an enriching experience, which expanded my perspective within the field of education.Immersed in various sessions, I delved into topics ranging from process data analysis to education policy and quantitative measurement methods. I discovered the predominant importance of tailoring presentations to specific audiences, ensuring that individuals with diverse research focuses can comprehend the significance of my work and provide their valuable feedback. As a result, I have obtained precious insights that will influence and enhance my future endeavors in both research methodology and presentation preparation.\n\nEngaging with professors, scholars, and researchers from diverse institutions during sessions and receptions provided a platform to exchange experiences and get insights into their perspectives on my research study. The opportunity to ask questions and receive feedback from experts within my field was beneficial, offering me a more comprehensive understanding of my study from various points.\n\nMy participation in the AERA conference has been an unforgettable journey. Marked by both academic discovery and personal growth. I would love to give my sincere gratitude again to my professors, my supervisor, my classmates, and the whole DSAN community for their unwavering support and encouragement. This experience has greatly strengthened my passion for research and sparked my further enthusiasm for contributing to the advancement of the educational measurement field.\n\n## **Kefan Yu**\n\nI am honored to have had my proposal accepted by the Division-D Methodology section of the AERA Conference. This provided me with the opportunity to present my project alongside Professor Qiwei Britt He during a poster presentation session.\n\nAs a student in the DSAN program, I have been deeply involved in several academic projects focusing on statistical modeling and measurement. While I have routinely shared findings with professors and fellow DSAN students, presenting at this conference is my first experience addressing a gathering of professional researchers and representatives from prominent educational institutions. The opportunity to present was exciting; it allowed me to exhibit the algorithms and techniques I have mastered throughout my studies. More importantly, the conference served as an important platform for networking and knowledge exchange.\n\nEngaging with experts from various fields, including educational policy, was particularly enlightening. For example, discussions about how to translate research findings into actionable policy changes or adapt them to different international countries has provided me with invaluable perspective on the practical applications of my work, which I seldom consider in my school projects.\n\n![Kefan stands in a conference hall in from of a large digital monitor that is displaying his poster.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/05/6.png)\n\nFurthermore, the ability to explain complex data science concepts to an audience without a technical background has not only enhanced my communication skills but also deepened my understanding of the subject matter. It is through these exchanges that I can see the tangible impact of my research on diverse communities.\n\nThis experience not only allowed me to showcase my academic progress but also facilitated significant professional growth through interactions with scholars and practitioners. The insights gained from these interactions are instrumental in refining my approach to educational research and will influence my future career in the field of educational measurement.",

    "markdown": "![Side by side image of the ](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/10/Featured-Images-Ivisible-Women-Book-Image.png)\n\n[Blog Posts](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/blog-posts/)\n\n# Sex and Gender Bias Considerations for Data Science\n\n![Viviana's Bitmoji character and byline](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/10/2-1.png)\n\nWhen I was young, I thought it was so unfair that my left-handed friends struggled when using scissors or had to go out of their way to sit at one of the few left-handed desks in the classroom– and when they weren’t available, they had to deal with being uncomfortable. I couldn’t believe it! The world wasn’t designed for them, and in attempts to adapt, they faced discomfort and disadvantages.\n\nI later understood that from a logistical standpoint, systems had to have fewer amenities for left-handed people because they make up approximately 10% of the population. They are a minority.\n\nAs I grew up, I started to think about how women make up half of the population, so they aren’t a minority ( _quantitatively._). So then why do they live in a world that isn’t designed for them, facing discomfort and disadvantages when trying to adapt?\n\nI recently read _Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men_ by Caroline Criado-Perez because I wanted to enter my data science education with an informed foundation of the sex and gender data gaps. **Data scientists are the “authors” of artificial intelligence. As a whole, we possess the power to control what the rest of the world knows and is able to accomplish from AI– and with great power comes great responsibility.** In a world where AI is increasingly becoming a tool that people rely on for help, explanation, and even the substitute for peoples’ jobs, it is imperative that the information AI produces reflects truth. The most basic data consideration is that data should be representative of the _population_. Not only by the design of those who have historically and systematically been more advantaged to land careers in data science.\n\nAs a quick refresher, “Bias in data is an error that occurs when certain elements of a dataset are overweighted or overrepresented. Biased datasets don’t accurately represent ML model’s use cases, which leads to skewed outcomes, systematic prejudice, and low accuracy. Often, the erroneous result discriminates against a specific group or groups of people.” 1 Machine learning (ML) and AI have the potential to amplify existing biases.\n\nThe main problem here is not that systems are purposefully designed specifically out of spite against women, but that women are simply not included enough in data that is used to inform important things, or in enough of the choices and design processes of our current public AI models. Estimates claim that women only make up 22% of AI and data science professionals2, and this is a big problem because it means that the majority of AI and data science models are created with hardly any female perspective or input. And although the number of women in the data science field is increasing, it doesn’t inherently reverse the accumulation of hidden biases so ingrained in our daily lives that we don’t even recognize them. It’s important to learn about them so that we can understand how to narrow the various channels of the sex and gender gaps moving forwards.\n\n_Invisible Women_ walks readers through how the male default bias, which refers to how typical masculine characteristics, ideologies, physiologies and perspectives are treated as the “standard” while the same premises for non-males are considered the “other,” both contributes to and perpetuates the gender data gap. The gender data gap describes the lack of non-typical-male representation in data that informs systems, models, and future research. Since the male default follows that what is male is normal and what is not is a deviation, it assumes that basing data off of mainly typical men is sufficient for the needs of everyone. But it’s not.\n\nFemale bodies, experiences, and needs are not the same, and this leaves many systems and models tuned for men and uncomfortable and disadvantageous for women.\n\n![Graphic addressing the genmder data  gap](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/10/Addressing-the-Gender-Gap.png)\n\nThere were four themes discussed in _Invisible Women_ that stood out to me the most as considerations for data science: data bias ingrained in 1.) large language models and translation AI, 2.) clinical trials and public health, 3.) safety, and 4.) urban planning.\n\n1. **Large Language Models and Translation AI**\n\nResearch has shown and practice has suggested that LLMs are trained on imbalanced datasets, and they tend to reflect those imbalances back, even with recent advancements in reinforcement learning with human feedback. A famous study found that LLMs “followed gender stereotypes in picking the likely referent of a pronoun: stereotypically male occupations were chosen for the pronoun he and stereotypically female occupations were chosen for the pronoun she”, and that “LLMs amplified the stereotypes associated with female individuals more than those associated with male individuals.”3 A classic example is that in Turkish, a gender-neutrally structured language, “o bir doktor” translates to “\\[any pronoun\\] is a doctor.” However, Google translate used to output “he is a doctor” when prompted for that translation.4\n\nIn 2018, Google released a statement announcing, “we’re taking the first step at reducing gender bias in our translations. We now provide both feminine and masculine translations when translating single-word queries from English to four different languages (French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish), and when translating phrases and sentences from Turkish to English.”5 The first step came a bit late, and the work being done is still not sufficient, for _she_ and _he_ are not the only gender pronouns.\n\n![Example of Google Translate translation before and after the company addressed the binary gender bias in translation.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/10/Google-Translate.png)\n\nThe world is changing and growing. Though there still exists a significant disparity, women and nonmales are increasingly taking up space in professional fields that were historically predominantly male. The LLMs we develop should reflect the future, not be stuck in the sexist past.\n\n2. **Health & clinical trials**\n\nWomen are disproportionately underrepresented in clinical trials.6 Therefore, claims like “this drug is 95% effective” are not always true– they’re only really true for men.\n\nGender data bias explains why Apple’s health tracker app did not include a menstrual cycle tracker when it launched, a feature that can be easily estimated and immensely helpful for a large proportion of users. This is a failure on the part of the data scientists and app developers. It also explains why in the U.S. there are five approved oral medications for erectile dysfunction, but none specialized for menstrual pain (we are just told to apply hot water and take an Ibuprofen). So apparently in clinical research, sexual pleasure for men appears to be more important than debilitating, excruciating pain experienced by women. It explains why Teva Pharmaceuticals faced lawsuits for marketing and manufacturing ParaGard IUDs that they knew could cause serious harm to people who use them.7 Do you think this product ever would have been released had the patients been men? There needed to be more honest data science and analytics before the release of this device, and this stresses the importance of data scientists having ethical backbones.\n\nBut beyond the gender data gap, there is an even deeper problem– the racial gender data gap. Though the breast cancer mortality rate among Black women is 41% higher than that of white women8, Black women only make up 5% of participants in clinical trials9. Black women are also three times more likely than white women to experience a pregnancy related death.10 These two examples make up a tiny fraction of the health disparities experienced by Black women, which are perpetuated by their lack of inclusion in data and subsequent lack of information and prioritization in healthcare. It is important to note that increasing data inclusion of only certain subgroups of women, presumably white women, could actually do the opposite of leveraging equity– it could drive further disparities and systematic disadvantages among minorities.\n\n3. **Vehicle safety**\n\nWhen car companies say that their products are safe, can we be sure they are truly safe for all? Women have historically been disproportionately injured and killed in car crashes, and that is because the safety of original car models were designed on male dummies only. A study that after 2003, when the vehicle safety testing standard had been changed to mandate the use of a female dummy in an occupant protection for front-impact testing, women were 19.2% more likely than men to be severely injured from crashes, compared to being 41% more likely before 200311. Including women in the data that we use to inform important features proves to save many lives and hospital bills.\n\n4. **Urban planning: can snow clearing be sexist?**\n\n“Can snow clearing be sexist?” was one of my favorite sentences in _Invisible Women_. When I read it, I almost laughed and thought, “no way!” Snow clearing procedures tend to first clear major roads, and then work their way down to smaller ones. The book notes that, typically, women spend more time on the smaller roads– pushing strollers, taking children to local activities, and running errands for other forms of unpaid labor.12 A study in Sweden investigated if changing the snow clearance procedure would have any impact on road injuries in the winter, and it found that “79% of pedestrian injuries occurred in winter, of which 69% were women. The estimated cost of these falls was 36 million Swedish Krona per winter, about USD $3.7 million USD. By clearing paths first, accidents decreased by half and saved the local government tons of money.” These findings validate that considering womens’ typical routes and daily routines when planning snow clearing priorities had significant public health and economic benefits.\n\nI strongly encourage you to read this book because I believe it will expand your perspective. And I didn’t write this blog to only motivate you to consider gender bias in your future with data, because gender is only part of the systematic bias problem. Race, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ identity, age, poverty and more are all subject to being disproportionately represented in the technology that may soon have an even more powerful chokehold over our global society. There are so many different types of biases present, so many that we don’t see or realize being ingrained in the models from which we train and design powerful technology and intelligence.\n\nWe must always remember that data isn’t fact. Data is potential fact that goes through the hands of subjective, individual humans, who subconsciously and maybe even innocently may have their own biases. The output can sometimes be a slight deviation from fact. It’s a fact for some, but not all. As data scientists, we owe it to the world to provide honest, fair information and systems from the data we work with. As data scientists, we owe it to the world to represent all. To do this, we need representation from all in the data science field.\n\nAside: So women are like left-handed people, left to make do with tools that are not designed in consideration for them. Evidence has suggested, however, that left-handed people tend to be more creative and brilliant… 😳\n\n**To read next:**\n\n- [Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy](https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815)\n- [Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Oppression-Search-Engines-Reinforce/dp/1479837245)\n- [Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor](https://www.amazon.com/Automating-Inequality-High-Tech-Profile-Police/dp/1250074312)\n\n- 1 Kamińska, “8 Types of Data Bias That Can Wreck Your Machine Learning Models.”   2 Young, Wajcman, and Sprejer, “Where Are the Women?: Mapping the Gender Job Gap in AI.

    "markdown": "[Faculty Profile](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/announcements/faculty-profile/)\n\n# Dr. Purna Gamage, Program Director and Associate Teaching Professor\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/purna-gamage-phd-35580042/)\n\n![Headshot of Dr. Purna Gamage](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2025/01/purna-min-1-1536x2048.png)\n\n## **Who had the greatest influence on your education and/or career path?**\n\nThe greatest influence on my education and career path undoubtedly comes from my father. His own aspirations and experiences played a pivotal role in shaping my journey. My dad had always dreamed of becoming a professor, but due to various circumstances, he ended up working in the banking industry instead. He has never lost sight of his academic passion, which left a profound mark on me.\n\nI consider myself privileged to have had the opportunity to pursue a career in academia, ultimately becoming a professor at this prestigious institution. Throughout this journey, my parents have been my pillars of support. They have encouraged and stood by me every step of the way, and they take immense pride in my achievements. This, and the constant source of inspiration I received from my mentors and professors throughout my life, has fueled my determination to succeed.\n\nToday, I am a female leader in academia, providing valuable contributions to society through education, and it is incredibly gratifying to have the opportunity to impact students’ lives and help shape the future generation.\n\n## **Why were you drawn to statistics?**\n\nI was always naturally drawn to statistics. Statistics make sense of the world, and I understood statistics easily. Getting straight A’s in my statistics classes during my undergraduate program in Sri Lanka (the second-ranked university in the country) made me love the subject even more!\n\n![Purna stands in a large room at a conference, smiling at the camera. She is wearing a taupe blazer and black shirt.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/11/Profile-Pics-3x4-1.png)\n\nWhat captivates me most about statistics is its ability to explain the intricacies of the world around us. Statistics is a powerful tool that allows us to dive deeper and understand important phenomena in the world in so many different areas, whether it’s in the realms of social dynamics, finance, healthcare, environmental impacts, or politics, among many others.\n\nThe fascination of statistics lies in its universal applicability and its capacity to facilitate informed decision-making across diverse fields. It has the potential to transform raw data into valuable knowledge, allowing us to address complex problems and contribute to the betterment of society. This multifaceted nature of statistics continues to fuel my passion for the subject and my dedication to harnessing its potential to positively impact the world.\n\n## **What do you enjoy most about your work?**\n\nFirst, I love working with students, interpersonal communication comes naturally to me, which enables me to connect with and guide students, which is immensely rewarding. My role involves leading and shaping our students into not only skilled data scientists but also compassionate and critical thinkers. Watching them grow and evolve into kind and capable leaders is a deeply gratifying aspect of my career.\n\nMoreover, I love being in the data science field. It’s a dynamic and ever-evolving discipline, which means there’s always something new to learn and explore. The practicality of this field is particularly exciting because it allows me to apply my knowledge to make a positive impact on the world. This aspect of my work constantly fuels my enthusiasm.\n\nI must also mention the incredible environment here at Georgetown University.  The entire Data Science and Analytics Program (DSAN) team feels like family to me. Getting immense support and motivation from my team and true appreciation from the dean of the graduate school, confirms the fact that a positive and supportive work environment is crucial, and I’m fortunate to have found that here.\n\n## **What’s the first piece of advice you would give to a DSAN student?**\n\nThe first and foremost piece of advice I would offer our students is to always be kind and professional. While technical skills are undoubtedly essential, what truly sets you apart in this field is your ability to maintain a respectful and courteous demeanor while collaborating with colleagues and clients alike. Always go above and beyond in your work, interactions, and responsibilities, as this not only enhances your reputation but also fosters strong and lasting relationships within the industry.\n\nAdditionally, it’s crucial to remember that in the realm of data science, a deep understanding of the underlying modeling frameworks is very important. Technical proficiency is valuable, but being a true data scientist requires the ability to understand the intricacies of the modeling processes and their implications. Continuously invest in enhancing your knowledge and skills in this area to excel in the field and contribute to making a positive impact on the world.\n\n## **What would people be surprised to learn about you?**\n\nI’m a Sri Lankan traditional (Kandyan) Dancer.\n\n## **What is the most gratifying part of being the DSAN Program Director?**\n\nThe most gratifying part of being the DSAN Program Director is the opportunity to witness the growth and development of our students and get a chance to make our students’ lives better\n\nIn my capacity as program director, I can play a pivotal role in shaping the program’s structure and curriculum, which, in turn, directly contributes to the development of our students’ education.  Beyond the scope of imparting technical knowledge, my role involves guiding and mentoring our students to become not only skilled data scientists but also compassionate and critical thinkers. Seeing them evolve into kind and capable leaders is a deeply rewarding aspect of my career. It’s immensely gratifying to watch them embrace the values of empathy, integrity, and professionalism while honing their technical skills.\n\nBeing able to contribute to the personal and professional development of our students and knowing that I play a part in shaping the future generation of data scientists is a source of great pride and fulfillment. It underlines the significance of my role and my commitment to providing them with the best possible education and mentorship.\n\n## **What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?**\n\nThe best advice I’ve ever received is that there will always be work, and it will still be waiting for you when you wake up tomorrow (unless it’s an emergency). Therefore, it’s crucial to take time for rest, enjoy moments with your family, and make sure to have personal time for yourself. This advice emphasizes the importance of work-life balance and serves as a reminder that while our professional pursuits are significant, taking care of our well-being and maintaining a healthy life outside of work is equally essential for long-term success and happiness.\n\n## **How do you hope to influence the direction of the DSAN program?**\n\nOne of my primary goals is to evolve the DSAN program into a dedicated Data Science Center. This expansion would create a hub for data science research, innovation, and education. It would serve as a focal point for collaboration between academia and industry, facilitating partnerships, research projects, and internship opportunities for our students.\n\nI also aim to broaden the horizons of our students by providing them with a wider array of opportunities. This includes forging partnerships with organizations, both locally and globally, to offer internships, co-op programs, and research initiatives that align with the evolving demands of the data science field. By enhancing their exposure to real-world applications, we can better prepare our students for successful careers.\n\nThe DSAN program has immense growth potential. My vision is to expand it not only in terms of student enrollment but also in its academic offerings and provide more opportunities for student growth. I envision the program evolving into a full-fledged department, offering undergraduate, graduate, and potentially even doctoral programs in data science to cater to a broader spectrum of students.\n\nExpanding the program to include a Ph.D. offering is a long-term objective. This would enable us to contribute to cutting-edge research in data science, foster innovation, and produce the next generation of thought leaders and researchers in the field.\n\n## **What 3 things would you want with you on a deserted island?**\n\nOne I would like to have would be my phone if it has a signal so that I could talk to my family.\n\nBut this may not be the case. I also don’t want to say that I want my family there with me because they will have a better life not being on a deserted island.\n\nSo I would go with a knife- for survival and to find food, a box of matches-  to make fire until I learned to make my own fire and some kind of a transmitter where I could send SOS messages.",

    "markdown": "![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/11/LinkedIn-Logo-Photo-scaled.jpg)\n\n[Blog Posts](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/blog-posts/)\n\n# Your Guide to Successful Networking Pt. 2\n\n![Patricia Schenfeld Byline and BitMoji](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/10/1-1.png)\n\n## **Networking on LinkedIn**\n\nLinkedIn is one of the most powerful tools you can use in your professional career. It has increasingly gained popularity over the past several years, and now it is a standard best practice when it comes to networking. We will go over some of the best ways to connect with others on LinkedIn!\n\nThere are many different uses to LinkedIn, but one of the most valuable ways to use it is for finding connections to help you land a job, learn about a new career path, or just expand your network.\n\nPersonally, I have found LinkedIn extremely useful when I have wanted to get a referral for a job I was interested in. These are the following steps I took which helped me land multiple job referrals and build new connections:\n\n![Companies on LinkedIn](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/11/Patricia-LinkedIn-Blog.jpg)\n\n1. First, navigate to the company’s page that you’re interested in working at.\n2. Within the company’s page, go to the ‘People’ tab and search for individuals who may have something in common with you. This would include attending the same universities or high schools, working at the same company, or being a part of the same organization (such as a fraternity or sorority). The image to the right shows my mobile application version of LinkedIn. I navigated to Google’s profile page and when I go to the ‘People’ tab, it automatically shows people that I might have a potential connection with. For instance, it shows the people that I am already connected with who work at Google, potential connections that attended the same university as me (Georgetown), and people who work in the town my profile is set to (Arlington, VA). This makes it very quick and easy to locate potential people to strike up a conversation with! **Note:** the desktop version will allow you to manually filter criteria to find people you have things in common with.\n3. Once you find a few people that you’re interested in connecting with, **this next step should be completed on the desktop version of LinkedIn.** Navigate to the person’s profile, and click the ‘Connect’ button. Without a LinkedIn premium membership, you cannot message people you are not connected to. It is unlikely that someone will accept your connection request without further context. This is where LinkedIn on your desktop browser comes in handy. After you click the ‘Connect’ button, you will be prompted to add a note to your invitation. This is where you can add some context to your invitation request. A simple message such as the following will do the trick: **“Hi \\[Name\\], I noticed we both attended \\[University\\]! I’m currently exploring opportunities in \\[industry/field\\] and would love to learn more about your role at \\[Company\\]. Would you be open to a quick chat to share your experience? Looking forward to connecting!”**\n4. Hopefully, your connection request is accepted. From here, you can coordinate a time to chat over the phone or video call (typically a 30 minute meeting is appropriate).\n5. During the video call, you have the opportunity to ask them questions about their career path, their current role at their company, and any advice they have for you. If your goal is to receive a referral to the company they work at, your chance to ask is **at the end of your conversation.** Once you feel that all of your questions have been answered, you can wrap up the phone call by saying something along the lines of this: **“Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me and discuss your career path. I’m planning on applying to the \\[Name of position\\] program and was wondering if you would be able to provide me with a referral? I’m happy to provide you with my resume or any other information!”** If they have already spent the time and effort to meet with you, they are most likely more than happy to provide you with a referral.\n\n![Screenshot of \"Add a Note\" option on LinkedIn](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/11/PS-Linkedin-Blog-2.png)",

    "markdown": "# Degree Requirements\n\nStudents in the DSAN program must successfully complete 30 credits and maintain a cumulative GPA of no less than 3.00.\n\n## Data Science and Analytics Coursework\n\nThere are five three-credit core courses that are designed to provide students with a solid foundation in data science. We also give a zero-credit programming bootcamp course in the summer prior to matriculation. The additional five three-credit elective courses allow students to learn tailored skills, helping them apply data analysis to fields of interest. Coursework may be taken in any order that is allowed by the prerequisites.\n\nCourses will be offered during the fall semester (late August through early December) and the spring semester (early January through early May). In addition, summer courses may be offered. Courses will typically meet once per week in the late afternoon or early evening.\n\nStudents may enroll on a full-time or part-time basis, usually starting in the fall semester of each academic year. Full-time students will be able to complete the degree in 16 calendar months by taking three courses per semester for three semesters, plus a summer course. Students may, however, take up to three years to complete the program, e.g. by taking one or two courses per semester plus summer courses.\n\nThe Georgetown DSAN program gives an online course in programming preparation that covers R, Python, and command line use in the summer prior to matriculation. The course is equivalent to three credits, is designed for matriculating MS Data Science & Analytics students, and is offered free of charge. It is required for all incoming students. This course will run during the Georgetown Summer Session (June – August). Students must complete this course to matriculate in the fall.\n\n## Full-Time Course Plan\n\n##### Fall Semester: Year One\n\n| Course Name | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN 5000 Data Science and Analytics (Core Course) | 3 |\n| DSAN 5100 Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Computing (Core Course) | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n\n##### Spring Semester:Year One\n\n| Course Name | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5200: Analytical Data Visualization (Core Course) | 3 |\n| DSAN-5300: Statistical Learning (Core Course) | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n\n##### Summer Semester between Year One and Year Two-Optional\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5925: Internship | .25 |\n\n**OR**\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective(s) | 3 (each) |\n\n##### Fall Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-6000: Big Data and Cloud Computing (Core Course) | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n\n##### Spring Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective | 3 |\n| Internship (Optional) | .25 |\n\nNote: You can graduate sooner by taking your final elective in the fall semester.\n\n## Part-Time Course Plan\n\n#### Fall Semester: Year One\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5000: Data Science and Analytics | 3 |\n| DSAN-5100: Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Computing | 3 |\n\n#### Spring Semester: Year One\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5200: Analytical Data Visualization | 3 |\n| DSAN-5300: Statistical Learning | 3 |\n\n#### Fall Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-6000: Big Data and Cloud Computing | 3 |\n| Elective | 3 |\n\n#### Spring Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective | 3 |\n| Elective | 3 |\n\n#### Fall Semester: Year Three\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective | 3 |\n| Elective | 3 |\n\n**Note: PT DSAN students may take 1 or 2 classes per semester, provided degree requirements are completed within 3 calendar years.

    "markdown": "[Faculty Profile](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/announcements/faculty-profile/)\n\n# Dr. Jeff Jacobs\n\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/jpowerj)\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/12/24.png)\n\n## **Who had the greatest influence on your education and/or career path?**\n\nWithout a doubt, that would be my PhD advisor, [Suresh Naidu](https://sites.santafe.edu/~snaidu/)!\n\nFrom about age 12, until I started my PhD, I had walked around with this huge chaotic blob of cognitive dissonance in my head. On the one hand, I knew that learning how math and computers worked gave me nice little dollops of serotonin: my favorite thing in the world was (and is!) seeing some absolutely mind-blowing theorem or seemingly-magic-based algorithm and diving into it until I could finally capital-U Understand it to some extent. At the same time, growing up in the densely-packed but hyper-segregated DC area as a white male meant watching from one side of 16th St while my non-white friends on the other side faced stressors I couldn’t even imagine having to deal with: getting harassed by police, worrying about whether they’d have food to eat that night, clothes to wear to school the next day, and so on. So I knew I had immense privilege, and I knew that this privilege implied a corresponding responsibility to push back against these inequities.\n\nSuresh provided me with a model of how one could be a responsible, “engaged” scholar. Reading his work and talking with him I think brought me towards a slow realization that I had completely goofed in seeing this as a zero-sum competition: an hour spent studying came at the cost of an hour I could be engaging with the _real world_, for example, and the weight of that tension would defuse my motivation to do either one. But, through the projects I worked on as a Ph.D. student within his lab, I slowly but surely began to see how these pursuits were mutually beneficial, erasing the all-or-nothing distinction between learning things as abstract theories and putting them into concrete practice. I immediately saw the _relevance_ of how the data-scientific techniques I was learning could be used to study things I cared about in the world.\n\nSuresh showed me, through his day-to-day life and his conduct as an advisor, scholar, and activist throughout all of these incredible projects, how it’s possible to be ethically and politically engaged _without compromising scientific rigor and scholarly integrity_. He taught me “The better you understand the world, the more effective you can be at changing it.”\n\n## **What is computational political theory, and what drew you to study it?**\n\nThe phrase “Computational Political Theory” came about in the same way that I’d guess new names for animals came about: I was trying to describe a type of bird I loved, and the person I was talking to would say “Oh, you mean an oriole?” And I’d say, no, not exactly, and they’d say “Oh, wait, you’re describing a raven!” And I’d say, no, that’s still not it, you’re just naming local sports team mascots now. (For my linguistics nerd friends: this is Quine’s [“Gavagai” problem](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.529086/page/n3/mode/2up) rearing its ugly head) Eventually—as my final paper for an incredible seminar class taught by [Joshua Simon](https://politicalscience.jhu.edu/directory/joshua-simon/) called _Interpretation and Critique of Political Ideas_—I started using that phrase to try and describe the theoretical part of my dissertation, where I was trying to flesh out what exactly it would mean for a computer to “read” a book or “examine” an archive.\n\nConcretely, for example, I fell into a _that-is-so-cool-I-must-study-it_ reverie during a class I took on the French Revolution, where the professor mentioned in passing something called the [_cahiers de doléances_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahiers_de_dol%C3%A9ances) or ”grievance books”. These were essentially the world’s first-ever mass public opinion surveys, conducted in 1789 by King Louis XVI to try and figure out why everyone was so mad at him at the time. Everyone in the entirety of France—peasants, nobles, members of the clergy from every region in the country—gathered in local assemblies to deliberate and write down all of their grievances against the monarchy. The issue is, that this resulted in about 40,000 big books filled with grievances that nobody had the time to read in full, especially not in time to stem the tide of revolution. So, in place of thorough reading, politicians from then onwards “cherry-picked” through them, scooping out a biased selection of whatever grievances served their polemical purposes at the time, regardless of how representative they were of the concerns of the French populace more broadly.\n\nSo, the notion of using computers to conduct a statistically-representative study of these grievances instead is where, to me, this project (which became my [thesis](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jjacobs3/Jacobs-Cahiers_Paper_2018-06-01.pdf) for the Quantitative Methods minor at Columbia) becomes even more exciting, since we can look at it as a fairly spot-on metaphor relating to modern-day issues like political polarization, media bias, misinformation, fake news, etc.: if we can come up with a way to have computers read and understand the grievances of various cross-sections of French society in 1789, incorporating and balancing _all_ of the information without any pre-existing biases towards particular political viewpoints, perhaps that same kind of algorithm could be used to help us process the vast mountain of opinions which now get blasted in our face every day on social media, in newspapers, on TV, and so on! That’s just one example of what excites me about Computational Political Theory and, if it sounds at all interesting to anyone, they can check out this [syllabus](https://cpt.pubpub.org/pub/cpt/release/9) from a whole course on the subject that (sadly) ended up canceled a few weeks before it was set to start, due to the COVID pandemic.\n\n## **What do you enjoy most about your work?**\n\nI genuinely don’t know where to start—in all honesty, it is my absolute dream job. But, one of the most rewarding aspects of teaching DSAN 5000 and 5100 specifically has been the opportunity to work with students on their final projects during office hours. Whether they’re describing an obstacle they’ve run into, or just hoping to brainstorm ideas for the next steps, I find myself getting completely engrossed in the conversations: along the way, I get to learn what motivates them, what their backgrounds are, what aspects of data science interest them in particular, what drew them to the particular dataset(s) they’re analyzing, and so on. It feels a bit like I’m at a party and everyone is telling me all about these cool new things I didn’t know about, but whereas at a party I have to write notes to myself for later (“google this when you get home!”), During office hours we get to dive directly into those things, exploring new datasets or algorithms and seeing how they can be incorporated into their projects.\n\n## **What’s the first piece of advice you would give to a DSAN student?**\n\nThat data science—and the math, computer science, and statistics that underlie it—doesn’t have to take the form of a bunch of symbols and equations that you stare at for a long time and then regurgitate onto a page when you take a test! That the scientific method gives us a general framework for understanding and [critically evaluating](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Fashionable_Nonsense/x6spAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) the great mass of information we encounter on a day-to-day basis, and that probability and statistics in particular give us tools for _integrating_ this new information with our previous experiences, allowing us to _update_ our knowledge about things in the world in a [systematic way](https://sites.santafe.edu/~simon/br.pdf) _(\\*cough\\*_ [_Bayes’ Rule_](http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/book.html) _\\*cough\\*)_.\n\n## **What would people be surprised to learn about you?**\n\nAs I get better at always being my full, authentic self around people I hope there are fewer and fewer surprises! But, given that I’m very far from that ideal, I feel like there may be a long list of things. Like…\n\n1. I follow the NFL and NBA religiously and grew up in a household of rabid Washington Commanders fans and season ticket holders\n2. I have an accidental ability to memorize song lyrics quickly so that I can sing along to a bunch of Regina Spektor or Imogen Heap or Sara Bareilles or Carly Rae Jepsen albums\n3. My legal middle name is Power, which was less weird in its original form as it was my Irish great-grandfather’s _last_ name\n\n## **What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?**\n\n_“Every topic in math is best learned twice, and even better learned three times!”_\n\nMy undergrad advisor at the University of Maryland, [William Gasarch](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/), is a full-on superhero in my eyes. As a tenured professor, he took (and continues to take!) whatever free time he had and used it to help weirdo high school students like myself see how cool math is, no matter how terrible our grades were or how “bad” we thought we were at math. He is the type of person who can come up with sayings like this on the spot, right when they are most desperately needed to cheer people up. They were his first words to me after I came into his office dejected, tears welling up in my eyes, after failing MATH 404: Galois Theory (the course number is forever etched in my brain) for a second semester in a row.\n\n## **If you could have one superpower, what would it be and why?**\n\nIt’s going to come across like I’m dodging the question, but I feel like neural networks and other machine learning algorithms already [give us sci-fi-level superpowers](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/), the ability to do things far beyond what my younger computer/math nerd self could have ever imagined. Of the many examples that have cemented this view in my head, a big one would be the [Artistic Style Transfer algorithms](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/style_transfer/overview) which started coming out in 2015: for decades, human creativity was held out as the _one_ thing that computers could never replace, at the core of what it meant for us to be human, and suddenly one day someone posts a paper showing how you can input a photo, tell the algorithm “paint this like Van Gogh… no, wait, like Seurat!”, and have their goofy selfie or cute photo of their pet instantly rendered as a beautiful work of art.\n\n## **What 3 things would you want with you on a deserted island?**\n\nMy French Bulldog Kozo, my cat Biko, and… probably the brain of a Zoomer, since getting stranded on a desert island is extremely fun to Zoomers: they pay money to spend hours and hours doing it, every day, and it’s called Minecraft.",

    "markdown": "![Campus from the Key Bridge](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/05/Student-Profile-Header.png)\n\n[News Story](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/news-story/)[Student Profile](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/announcements/student-profile/)\n\n# Renee DeMaio\n\n![Student profile headshot of Renee DeMaio](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/04/44.png)\n\n## **Why did you choose the DSAN program at GU?**\n\nI chose the DSAN program at Georgetown because it was the perfect next step to fully embrace my love of data and numbers. Since I was young, I’ve always made sense of the world through patterns. Taking my first statistics class in high school introduced me to data in an organized format, and solidified that it was data that helped me get a more comprehensive look into the patterns that I liked to observe as a kid.\n\nDSAN specifically was the right choice for me because I was able to enroll in the [accelerated program](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/accelerated-program/). Having lost my first year of college to Covid, I felt like staying at Georgetown for a little more time would allow me to get the full Georgetown experience I was looking for. DSAN’s faculty were more than welcoming from the beginning of the application process and they were so willing to help me explore my interests, so every interaction with them made me excited to apply.\n\n## **As an accelerated student, you are finishing up your majors in Chinese Language and Literature, and Mathematics while completing your first year of your master’s degree!! What inspired you to pursue these seemingly diverse subjects?**\n\nI definitely have an odd education background! The major in Chinese Language and Literature is probably the one that throws people off the most. I spent all of my life in Asia, more specifically Hong Kong and Singapore, before moving to the United States to attend university. Mandarin was always in my schooling, starting from the age of 4, so it felt important to me to continue that, especially as I navigated moving across the world and away from any cultural familiarity I had. Particularly in a time like Covid, where I was unsure when I would be able to return home but knew it would be a while, staying connected to the things that made me feel like me was really important, so I stuck close to Chinese.\n\nHowever, just Chinese didn’t fully satisfy my brain, so I decided to pursue math as well. Math had the patterns that Chinese lacks and doing both helped me feel challenged in all the right ways academically. I found early on that my brain always worked well with numbers and patterns, and I always enjoyed the systematic nature of math in school. I took a statistics class in high school and loved when I could apply those systems to analyze patterns in the data I was analyzing. Learning about different populations and topics through methods that clicked with my brain is what made math really fun for me and is what made me pursue data science.\n\n## **Who had the greatest influence on your career/education path?**\n\nMy high school AP Statistics teacher, Mr. Hamilton, has had the greatest influence on my education path. I took his class in my senior year of high school, 2019-2020, which was a hard year for Hong Kong in many ways. In 2019, the pro-democracy protests filled all of our lives. It was a complicated time for me emotionally. It was really hard to see the city I love so much go through so much turmoil, and all the places I played as a little girl filled with such vivid conflict. But at the same time, it was really empowering to get to see so many Hong Kong people standing together and to stand with them. The routine of school was nice in a time of chaos.\n\nBut then Covid hit Hong Kong in January of 2020 and it felt like a 1-2 punch in some ways. Mr. Hamilton’s class routine and positive outlook never wavered, which felt comforting. He was always someone who encouraged my learning and who I knew cared about me as a person, not just as a student, which is something that became more clear during online school.\n\nNine months or so after I graduated from high school, I sent Mr. Hamilton an email because I saw something that reminded me of him. We continued to stay in contact over email through these past four years. In every email he asked so many questions about my life, my education, and my ambitions, and regardless of whatever stream-of-consciousness answer I gave him, he always responded with support. Even after all these years, he still makes me feel incredibly seen, in a way that I know is so genuine because of who he is as a person. Having someone believe in me so unwaveringly has given me so much confidence that what I’m doing is right for me, no matter how my plans may change.\n\n![Renee DeMaio at the finish line of a marathon, holding her medal.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/04/45.png)\n\n## **How do you hope to pursue your interest in professional sports, and social justice and human rights issues, as you move forward in your career?**\n\nMy interests are definitely all over the place but I think the diversity of them allows me to not be set on doing one type of work. The one thing that ties them together is an element of gender dynamics. For professional sports, I love watching and supporting women’s sports and if I were to pursue a career in professional sports, I’d want to work to advance women’s sports.\n\nAs for social justice and human rights issues, the issues I care a lot about are women’s issues. Recently, I’ve been more interested in the biomedical aspects of women’s issues, particularly how medical data can be biased towards cis-gendered men. Moving forward in my career, I am interested in pursuing a career in biostatistics or working with biomedical data that focuses on women and non-binary individuals, to ensure that there is fair representation of every gender in the biomedical field.\n\n## **What is your favorite class in the DSAN program so far?**\n\nAs an accelerated student, I’ve had a bit of a different path than non-accelerated students, so I’ve only taken two DSAN classes: DSAN 5000 and DSAN 5100. I think out of the two, my favorite so far has been DSAN 5000 because of how much progress I got to see myself make in the course of a semester. I started out knowing close to nothing, and by the end of the semester, I ended up producing a project I was proud of. The DSAN 5000 project is one that helps you to look back on all the skills that you’ve developed over the course of the semester, so it was a great first class to start with for me to stay encouraged.\n\n## **Any advice you’d give prospective students?**\n\nBe patient with yourself as you learn. I got really frustrated to begin with because my assignments were taking much longer than I thought they would, and because I didn’t understand as quickly as I wanted to. Data science, particularly the coding aspects of it, is something that takes practice and a determination to succeed when the code doesn’t work out quite right. Patience, both with yourself and with your computer, as well as starting assignments as early as possible, will help you succeed.\n\n## **What would people be surprised to learn about you?**\n\nA lot of people would be surprised to know that I spent all of my life in Asia before moving to the United States for university and that I speak fluent Mandarin! My family has lived and currently live in Hong Kong and we spent a number of years in Singapore too. Mandarin was always in my schooling, starting from the age of 4 when I started pre-school, so being able to speak it is immensely important to me. Growing up there and getting to call these two places my home has been and will continue to be the greatest privilege of my life.\n\n## **Favorite way to spend your free time?**\n\nThe thing I look forward to the most in my free time is reading. I spend most of my breaks doing that, reading copious amount of books over school holidays, I think I read 8 over last winter break and read four in four days over spring break. I also love buying books but have forced myself to pause until my reading can catch up with my buying.\n\nApart from reading, I dance a lot! I am on two dance teams at Georgetown: Ritmo y Sabor, a Latin dance team which I co-direct, and Groove Theory, a hip-hop team. I’ve been dancing since I was a little girl but the most fun I’ve had in my dance career has been at Georgetown. I’ve also recently taught myself how to crochet which has been very fun, I have just finished my first two projects which was a headband for myself and another for my sister!\n\n## **If you could have any superpower what would it be, and why?**\n\nIf I had a superpower, I would definitely want to speak every language. I always find myself wishing that I could speak more languages to be able to understand and to connect with more people. I think I’d also enjoy shocking people by speaking the language. No one looking at me would assume I speak Mandarin so it’s really funny to me to watch people’s reactions to them when I respond to them in Mandarin.\n\n[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-PMZB7WHYPX&gacid=1055261625.1743610969&gtm=45je53v1v9104793239z877583222za200zb77583222&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=102788824~102803279~102813109~102887800~102926062~102975949~102976415&z=1504509348)[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-BSC82Y20RS&gacid=1055261625.1743610969&gtm=45je53v1v9104488821z877583222za200zb77583222&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=102509683~102788824~102803279~102813109~102887799~102926062~102975949~102976415&z=1954135013)[iframe](https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/up?adv=tz1xvy0&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.georgetown.edu%2Fannouncements%2Fstudent-profile%2Frenee-demaio%2F&upid=a8id7gz&upv=1.1.0&paapi=1)\n\n![](https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=13014621&tm=gtm002&Ver=2&mid=1dfa0c62-e575-4bf0-b794-ed98614ab201&bo=1&sid=b92705e00fde11f0bf92156d9ab990f5&vid=b926fb500fde11f0a5d82d415beacfc3&vids=1&msclkid=N&pi=918639831&lg=en-US&sw=1280&sh=1024&sc=24&tl=Renee%20DeMaio%20%7C%20Master%20of%20Science%20in%20Data%20Science%20%26%20Analytics%20%7C%20Georgetown%20University&p=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.georgetown.edu%2Fannouncements%2Fstudent-profile%2Frenee-demaio%2F&r=&lt=1579&evt=pageLoad&sv=1&cdb=AQAA&rn=290210)",

Graduate programs can be overwhelming and even isolating at times. It is part of our mission to ensure that our students have a safe and supportive environment in which to thrive.\n\n#### Looking for a supportive community that will walk through your graduate school journey with you? Look no further! Our program fosters a sense of belonging with several initiatives and opportunities for connection, from our Mentorship Program to our regular DSAN social events. Check out some of the ways that we support community building among our DSAN cohorts, staff, faculty, and alumni.\n\n## DSAN Social Committee\n\nThe DSAN Social Committee was formed with the belief that student leadership is integral to ensuring that our program’s events are targeted to the evolving needs of our student body. The committee consists of students from both our first and second-year cohorts.\n\nNow in its second year, the Social Committee has become a force for connection within our community. They assist with planning and support for many of our program-sponsored events, while also creating smaller ad hoc opportunities for socializing, e.g. trivia night, hiking trips, etc.\n\n[Skip the following collection of 3 photos and continue to the content immediately following.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/our-community/#carousel-skipped)\n\nSlide 1 _of_ 3\n\nSlide1 _of_ 3\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/5-1024x768.png)\n\nSlide2 _of_ 3\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/1-1-1024x768.png)\n\nSlide3 _of_ 3\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/4-1024x768.png)\n\nEnd of carousel collection.\n\n## Student Mentorship Program\n\nOur built-in student support system provides incoming students with guidance and advice as they move through their first year in our program. Incoming students are matched with a second-year student mentor based on their undergraduate major, common goals, and shared interests.\n\nMentors act as a consistently available resource for incoming students, and may provide guidance on topics such as where to live; what to expect from classes; how and when to start looking for an internship; and any other questions first-year students might have. Mentors and mentees meet for lunch, dinner, coffee, and various activities in Washington, D.C. Mentors are available throughout the year whenever their mentees need guidance.\n\n[Skip the following collection of 4 photos and continue to the content immediately following.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/our-community/#carousel-skipped)\n\nSlide 1 _of_ 4\n\nSlide1 _of_ 4\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/hiking3-1024x768.jpg)\n\nSlide2 _of_ 4\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/1-3-1024x1024.png)\n\nSlide3 _of_ 4\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/3-2-1024x768.png)\n\nSlide4 _of_ 4\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/2-2-1024x768.png)\n\nEnd of carousel collection.\n\n## The DSAN Suite\n\nAs our program has grown, our suite has become a study haven for many of our students.

This workshop covers how linguists gather, process and analyze code-switched data. We will explore the NPL pipeline for processing multilingual texts and discuss various approaches to language identification.\n\n## Bio:\n\nJacqueline Serigos is an Assistant Professor of Spanish Linguistics in the Department of Modern and Classical Languages at George Mason University. Her research explores various forms of language contact, such as lexical borrowings, code-switching, and calques. She employs approaches from multiple linguistic subfields, including corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, and semantics, as well as the discipline of statistics. She received her BA in Anthropology and Latin American Studies from Emory University and a PhD in Hispanic Linguistics from the University of Texas at Austin.",

    "markdown": "[Student Profile](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/student-profile-2/)\n\n# Chao Li\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chao-li-2933721b0/)\n\n![Chao Li sitting on a ledge in front of desert mountains.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/1-4.png)\n\n**_Chao (’23) entered our program having completed a Master of Commerce from the University of Sydney and recently graduated from the DSAN program in May._**\n\nChao’s dedication to innovation, curiosity, and voracious thirst for knowledge are sure to fuel a fascinating and change-making career.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Journey to DSAN**\n\nChao comes from a finance background, and was focused on gaining experience that would augment careers in investment banking or quantitative research. As he began to move through the early stages of his career, he found that data science could help him in his work, e.g. he could use machine learning to build a trading strategy. This realization led him to begin searching for a master’s program in data science.\n\nOur program’s ideal location in DC was one of the guiding factors in Chao choosing the Georgetown Data Science and Analytics Program (DSAN). The opportunity to access excellent social resources and connect with leaders in the field would be undeniable assets to his career and graduate experience. Chao was also drawn to the DSAN program’s focus on data science and not just data analytics, and an enticing course structure with classes like Natural Language Processing and Blockchain made the program a natural fit. Blockchain specifically is integral to Chao’s work, and learning more about it was a necessity.\n\n## **The Business of Blockchain**\n\nChao has been doing blockchain-related work since 2019. During that time he learned the basic structure of Bitcoin and began to realize that this would be an important, future-focused technology. It’s an innovation for the financial world, a disruption unprecedented in the modern financial sector. As he dove deeper into Bitcoin he began to find that this area was beginning to attract a lot of innovative, brilliant people who would help this technology grow and make a significant contribution to the world.  He strives to be one of the people who steps into this area in its early stages. He states that “it’s very hard for our students to get into the traditional financial world because it’s very mature and stable.” Chao is an avid self-learner. Before taking the DSAN blockchain course, he used Google and YouTube to find ways to teach himself about the technology, giving him an excellent springboard into formal blockchain training.\n\n## **An Innovative Future**\n\nChao is a ambitious innovator with a fascination for future-focused technology, and is driven to make a difference in the blockchain space. One of his favorite classes was Natural Language Processing, taught by Dr. Chris Larson. He and Dr. Larson talked quite a bit about state-of-the-art models, and that class was his first contact with complex modeling. When he first started the class, he recalled predicting that NLP would be the next big thing. And, lo and behold, ChatGPT has changed the game!\n\nBlockchain technology will only become more applicable in the future, and Chao highlighted Dr. Nakul Padalakar’s Blockchain class as being one of his favorites. He was grateful for Dr. Padalkar’s dedication to explaining the systemic basis for blockchain as an academic area as well as helping his students understand how researchers and professionals view blockchain and the innovations it has helped create.\n\n> _I am incredibly impressed by his unwavering enthusiasm for blockchain and distributed ledgers. His dedication to self-learning and his formal training in the blockchain course position him as a proactive contributor ready to make a significant impact in the field. His continuous drive to bring blockchain collaboration to the class and the DSAN students shows his passion and love for technology, fostering academic and industrial collaboration. Chao’s passion and commitment to staying at the forefront of cutting-edge technologies are truly commendable, and I do not doubt that he will continue to drive innovation forward._\n>\n> Dr. Nakul Padalkar, Assistant Teaching Professor, DSAN\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nSpecifically for students coming from outside the US, Chao feels that it is vital to make sure to focus on professional development opportunities in the private sector that are open to hiring international applicants, embrace opportunities to interact with fellow US-based students, and engage in cross-cultural events.\n\n## **In His Free Time**\n\n**Reading**: _Systematic Trading_ by Robert Carver. “This a good book introducing you to building your trading system.”\n\n**Listening:** To my favorite two podcast channels: _Trading Camp_– “Each episode will include an interview about the trader’s daily work, like what they are doing and what they are thinking about the trading” and _Odd Lots_– “Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway analyze the weird patterns, the complex issues, and the newest market crazes. Join the conversation every Monday and Thursday for interviews with the most interesting minds in finance, economics, and markets.”\n\n“Also, some similar podcasts from my favorites like Crypto 101, Planet Money, Trading Nut, Masters in Business, Chat with Traders, etc.”\n\n**Watching**: _3Blue1Brown_ “to learn some mathematics in a funny way” and _Binance Academy_, “it is the place where I learned a lot about crypto.”\n\n**Playing**: “Definitely the strategic game: _Clash of Clans_. I love it!”",

All my great teachers from different educational phases are exceptional role models. From elementary school to graduate school, the teachers inspired me through this path to become a person just like them. Their passion, persistence, and care for students deeply attracted me to dedicate myself to the education field. Even though I started my career as a researcher, not directly as a professor, the research field is still related to education and testing. I really enjoy accurate measurement for latent structures.\n\n## **What drew you to psychometrics and adaptive measurement?**\n\nTo measure people’s latent ability with big data is very cool. The whole process arouses my great curiosity. Everybody experiences tons of assessments from childhood to adulthood, but people seldom understand why the test could make accurate and precise predictions. The adaptive measurement is magic, using shorter tests, and different tasks for different people, but could measure even more accurately for people’s latent abilities.\n\n## **What do you enjoy most about your work?**\n\nTo work with students is the most enjoyable work in the world, especially to attract more students into the measurement field, which is a very promising but understated area so far. I feel very proud of my students who succeed in their academic and future careers, and surely proud of myself for being a great mentor to help the younger generation find the most optimal path for their further growth.\n\n## **What’s the first piece of advice you would give to a DSAN student?**\n\nDon’t read with your eyes closed. Open your eyes and mind, there are a lot of opportunities around you. Get well prepared for the coming opportunity.\n\n## **What would people be surprised to learn about you?**\n\nI was a core member of the Artistic Gymnastics Varsity Team in college, and we won the National Championship in China.\n\n## **What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?**\n\nPractice makes perfect.\n\n## **If you could have one superpower, what would it be and why?**\n\nMy superpower will send me anywhere on my wish list within one hour because time is so precious and should be saved to enjoy the destination.\n\n## **What 3 things would you want with you on a deserted island?**\n\nI will bring my husband and two sons. The experience on a deserted island is so cool that I could not “enjoy” it by myself.\n\n[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-BSC82Y20RS&gacid=1476286120.1743610995&gtm=45je53v1v9104488821z877583222za200zb77583222&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=102015666~102788824~102803279~102813109~102887800~102926062~102975949~102976415&z=902956459)[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-PMZB7WHYPX&gacid=1476286120.1743610995&gtm=45je53v1v9104793239z877583222za200zb77583222&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=102509682~102788824~102803279~102813109~102887799~102926062~102975949~102976415~103016951&z=38071047)\n\n![](https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=13014621&tm=gtm002&Ver=2&mid=619b7b08-8067-47de-ad5f-1fe6992a505a&bo=1&sid=c7bbc8d00fde11f0badb6f6281ed4065&vid=c7bbcb400fde11f0a466b917850aa52b&vids=1&msclkid=N&pi=918639831&lg=en-US&sw=1280&sh=1024&sc=24&tl=Dr.%20Qiwei%20Britt%20He%20%7C%20Master%20of%20Science%20in%20Data%20Science%20%26%20Analytics%20%7C%20Georgetown%20University&p=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.georgetown.edu%2Fannouncements%2Ffaculty-profile%2Fdr-qiwei-britt-he%2F&r=&lt=569&evt=pageLoad&sv=1&cdb=AQAQ&rn=631112)\n\n[iframe](about:blank)",

This talk explores the two machine learning approaches included in MITRE’s submission to a shared task, SemEval-2018 Task 11: Machine Comprehension using Commonsense Knowledge. The first system is a logistic regression over simple features like question length and lexicalized patterns. The second is a recurrent neural network with attention, which uses a pretrained semantic space and learns to align words of the story, passage, and answers. The resulting ensemble system answers reading comprehension questions with 82.27% accuracy and ranked second in the task. This strong performance, despite limited use of external knowledge sources or explicit reasoning, raises questions about “commonsense knowledge” in this task.\n\n## Bio:\n\nLiz Merkhofer is a lead computational linguist at the MITRE Corporation, where she focuses on neural models/deep learning. Her work especially focuses on representation and transfer learning, for applications ranging from monitoring mental health-related messages in social media, judicial adjudication support, textual similarity, and content-based recommendation. She holds a BA in Philosophy and Spanish from the University of Arizona and a MA in Linguistics for Georgetown University.\n\nTagged[News](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/tag/news/)",

    "markdown": "# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n## Applications\n\n**Do you require the GRE?**\n\nNo.\n\n**Can I waive the TOEFL?**\n\nIf you earn your degree from an accredited institution in which English is the primary language of instruction, you do not have to submit TOEFL/IELTS scores.\n\n**Will you consider TOEFL MyBest score?**\n\nNo, we do not accept the TOEFL MyBest Score.\n\n**Can I update my TOEFL/IELTS score after submitting my application?**\n\nYou can resubmit your TOEFL/IELTS scores, but if you do so after December 15th, it can affect your status as a priority applicant. If you are aiming for the January 15th deadline, you can update your scores before the final deadline.\n\n**How do I edit a recommender’s personal information or change my recommender?**\n\n[Log in to the application portal](https://gradapply.georgetown.edu/account/login?r=https%3a%2f%2fgradapply.georgetown.edu%2fapply%2f), and then navigate to your application status page and click the link below the checklist to get to the recommendations page. Select the recommender you would like to edit or update. To change the email address of a recommender, click on their name on the recommendations page then click “exclude.” Then re-add the recommender using the updated email address.\n\n**My recommender is unable to receive the link or submit their letter – what should I do?**\n\nPlease have your recommender double check their spam folder for the link. If all else fails, they may email their letter to the Office of Graduate Admissions at [gradmail@georgetown.edu](mailto:gradmail@georgetown.edu).\n\n**How should I submit my WES evaluation?**\n\nYou will not need to send your WES report to our school at this time; instead, you should ask WES to send the evaluation directly to you, and then you should upload the evaluation directly to the online application. An official transcript will be required if you are offered admission to the program.\n\n**How can I check to see if all of my application materials have been received?**\n\nYou can check the status of application materials, including test scores, transcripts, letters of recommendation, etc. by navigating back to our [online application](https://gradapply.georgetown.edu/account/login?r=https%3a%2f%2fgradapply.georgetown.edu%2fapply%2f) and viewing your application status page. Please note it can take up to 24 hours for the system to process materials and reflect this on your status page.\n\n**When are the application deadlines?**\n\nOur **Fall Priority deadline is December 15th**. All supporting materials will also need to be submitted by this date for priority consideration. Our **Fall Final deadline is January 15th**. All supporting materials must also be submitted by this date for consideration.\n\nFor our **Accelerated BS/MS program** (for Georgetown students only) has **both a fall and spring admission date**. The final **Fall Semester deadline is February 15th** and all supporting documentation must be received by this date for consideration for Fall admission. The final **Spring Semester deadline is October 1st** and all supporting documentation must be received by this date for consideration for Spring admission.\n\n**When can I expect to receive my admission decision?**\n\nIf you apply and your application is complete (all materials received) by our priority deadline of **December 15**, you can expect to receive a decision by **March 1 or earlier**. If you apply and your application is complete by our final deadline of **January 15**, you can expect to receive a decision by **April 1 or earlier**. If all of your application materials are received after our final deadline, your application will be reviewed and you will receive a decision, but we cannot guarantee that you will receive your decision by a particular date.\n\n**Can I apply to your program and another GU program?**\n\nGeorgetown does allow prospective students to apply to multiple graduate programs, but you must submit two separate applications and pay two separate application fees.\n\n**I have two majors, how should I fill out the application history part of the application?**\n\nOur admissions committee will carefully read your transcript and resume, and they will see that you have two majors. However, in the interest of completing the online application, it is suggested that you choose your main focus or the subject area that is most relevant to our program.\n\n**Can I get an application fee waiver?**\n\nUnfortunately, we do not offer application fee waivers. If you would like to learn more about the financial support you can receive at Georgetown, please check [here.](https://grad.georgetown.edu/financial-support/)\n\n**Can I be admitted for Spring semester?**\n\nOur program does not offer Spring admission.\n\n**How do I contact the Office of Graduate Admissions?**\n\nPhone: 202-687-5568\n\nFax: 202-687-6802\n\nE-mail: [gradmail@georgetown.edu](mailto:gradmail@georgetown.edu)\n\n## Preparing for Your Degree\n\n**How much mathematics coursework should I have to be successful in this program?**\n\nStudents who apply should have taken Calculus I & II at the college level. It is also essential to have taken a full course in multivariable (vector) calculus and done well in it (B or better). Linear algebra is highly desirable but not required. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to contact the program.\n\n**How much experience with statistics should I have to be successful in this program?**\n\nApplicants should have taken a calculus-based statistics course that covers elementary probability, properties of random variables, common discrete and continuous distributions, expectations, the central limit theorem, parameter estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and possibly elements of linear regression. It is desirable if you have used a computational statistics package in this class, for example SPSS, R, or Stata. If you have taken the first course of a statistics sequence for economics majors (the second course would then be econometrics), you may also be adequately prepared. If you have questions, please [contact the program](mailto:gradanalytics@georgetown.edu?subject=I%20have%20a%20question%20about%20my%20statistics%20preparation).\n\n**How much computer science experience should I have to be successful in this program?**\n\nR and Python are used extensively throughout the program. R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, and Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Students should have working experience or have taken coursework on these languages prior to admission. In addition, introductory computer science coursework focusing on C++ and/or Java will help familiarize students with general programming.\n\n**I haven’t taken a programming course in college, but I became proficient with programming languages while working for my current employer and am now spending most of my time coding in that language. How should I document my computer science proficiency?**\n\nAlthough we prefer live (classroom-based) courses, you can take an online certificate program in R or Python and upload the certificate with your application to demonstrate proficiency. You can also ask a supervisor to submit a letter of recommendation in which your coding work could be addressed.\n\n**I expect to have some time available before I enter the program this Fall. How can I better prepare during the summer?**\n\nThe Georgetown Data Science & Analytics program gives an online course in programming preparation that covers R, Python, and command line use in the summer prior to matriculation. The course is equivalent to three credits, is designed for matriculating MS Data Science & Analytics students, and is offered free of charge. It is required for all incoming students. This course runs during the Georgetown Summer Session. Students must complete this course to matriculate in the fall. It is not an intro course, and assumes at least a basic level of proficiency in R and Python. If you do not have a basic knowledge of both languages, we highly recommend taking some online courses before taking our summer online course.\n\n**I have only taken Calculus I and Calculus II. Can I get admitted to this program?**\n\nYou can take our required courses at a local college before applying. Many community colleges offer these courses at convenient times. If you are unable to take a classroom-based course, the next best thing is to take a certificate course online. We’re happy to work with you to prepare a plan. You should also refresh your calculus knowledge before enrolling in our required courses.\n\n**I don’t have any programming experience. Can I get admitted to this program?**\n\nYou can acquire this experience in a number of ways, including college courses, online certificates, and and company training. We expect applicants to have a basic knowledge of both R and Python. A good place to start is our list of suggested [resources for completing the prerequisites](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/how-to-apply/#resources-for-completing-prerequisites).\n\n**I am currently taking prerequisite coursework to fulfill program admission requirements. Can I apply for admission before I have completed the course(s) and be admitted to this program?**\n\nAlthough you are permitted to apply without the prerequisites, you should be aware that you will be competing against applicants who have already completed the prerequisite courses and can provide final grades for them. If you are taking prerequisite coursework when you apply, please indicate on your application that these courses are “in-progress.” When you have completed the courses, please be sure to upload a new transcript reflecting the course grades.\n\n**I have not taken one or more prerequisite courses. Can I take these classes over the summer before Fall classes begin?**\n\nAlthough you are permitted to apply without the prerequisites, you should be aware that you will be competing against applicants who have already completed the prerequisite courses and can provide final grades for them. So while you have a chance of being admitted if the rest of your application is strong, your application will not be as competitive as those who have already completed the required courses. You would have a much better chance of being admitted if you complete all prerequisites before applying. A good place to start is our suggested list of [resources for completing the prerequisites](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/how-to-apply/#resources-for-completing-prerequisites).\n\n**I took Econometrics in college, and we did a good deal of statistics in that course. Am I prepared adequately?**\n\nThis preparation is usually sufficient. To make sure, please send us more detail about your preparation, including perhaps a syllabus or information about the textbook that was used.\n\n**Is there a minimum GPA for applicants?**\n\nThe Graduate School expects a B-average (3.0 or better) for applicants. We want to make sure that entering students can meet or come close to this requirement. For a successful application, evidence of success in advanced mathematics, statistics and/or computer science courses is even more important. If the application shows this, a student with a slightly lower GPA may still have a chance of admission.\n\n## Financial Questions\n\n**What kind of financial assistance is available for students?**\n\nThe Data Science & Analytics program offers merit-based scholarships to both incoming and continuing students. There are also opportunities for student employment as a research assistant or teaching assistant. You can learn about how assistantships work by visiting the [Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Financial Support](http://grad.georgetown.edu/financial-support) page. As a returning student in your second year, you will be eligible to compete for a [merit-based scholarship](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/returning-scholarships/).\n\n**What other possibilities are there for student employment?**\n\nThere are Research Assistant (RA) and Teaching Assistant (TA) opportunities on campus. Assistantships are generally awarded to continuing students who have performed well academically. These positions are usually found through word-of-mouth or via [Georgetown’s Student Employment Office](https://seo.georgetown.edu/JobX_FindAJob.aspx?t=qs&qs=21); you need a NetID to log in, which can be found in your offer letter.\n\n**Will I receive an automatic offer of financial assistance when I get admitted?**\n\nOur scholarships are merit-based and are not determined based on financial need. _**All applicants**_ are considered for merit-based scholarships.\n\n**If I don’t receive an offer for a scholarship upon admission, will I have another chance once I am enrolled?**\n\nAs a returning student in your second year, you will be eligible to compete for a [merit-based scholarship](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/returning-scholarships/).\n\n## Course Planning\n\n**How many courses can I take at a time?**\n\nThree courses per semester is the normal load for full time students. Part-time students who also have a full-time job may take either one or two courses per semester. Working full time and taking three graduate courses is not recommended.\n\n**Can I be a part-time student?**\n\nYes. This is possible for students who are not on a student visa. This may be a good option for students who wish to continue their full-time job while attending the program, especially if they receive financial support from their employer. Graduate School rules state that students admitted to a master’s degree program are allowed three years from matriculation to complete all requirements for the degree.\n\n**Is it possible to switch between part-time and full-time status?**\n\nYes. It is possible to switch back and forth between full-time and part-time status, and many students do this depending on their desired balance of work and study. However, international students must remain on full-time status throughout and may only switch to part-time status during their last semester. In addition, students should keep in mind that they are required to complete the program within three calendar years.\n\n**Do graduate students have academic advisors?**\n\nYes. Individual advising is available to all graduate students.\n\n**Does the program offer graduate courses during the summer?**\n\nYes, the Data Science & Analytics program typically offers one to two classes during summer semester. Students may also take coursework from other programs to satisfy elective requirements during the summer.\n\n**When and where will classes be offered?**\n\nAll classes will be offered on Georgetown University’s Main Campus. View directions to the [Main Campus](https://www.georgetown.edu/plan-your-visit/#visiting-main-campus) and [campus maps](http://maps.georgetown.edu/). Classes in this program usually meet one day per week, often in the late afternoon (3:30 – 6:00pm) or evening (6:30 – 9:00pm), although we also offer morning classes.\n\n**How easy is it to take courses in other programs or departments?**\n\nThe Data Science and Analytics program offers a large number of elective classes tailored specifically toward our students, so we highly recommend that you select electives within our program! However, if you have a specialized interest, you can talk to us about taking an elective class in another department if it is relevant to your degree.\n\n**Is it possible to take courses out of sequence?**\n\nWe strongly recommend against it. The curriculum has been carefully designed to maximize your experience and your performance.\n\n**How often are the core and elective courses offered?**\n\nThe required core courses and the elective courses are offered every year. DSAN-5000: Introduction to Data Analytics is always offered in the Fall.\n\n**What is the typical number of students in a graduate class?**\n\nThe class size will typically be capped at 25-35, but classes will also run with smaller sizes.\n\n**Will I be able to get a seat in the course I want to take?**\n\nYou will always be able to get a seat in core Data Science & Analytics courses. Popular electives in the Data Science & Analytics program sometimes fill to capacity, but this is rare.\n\n**Can I take elective courses before completing the core courses?**\n\nYes. This is possible, and you are encouraged to do so. Be sure to check the prerequisites of any course that you wish to take.\n\n**I have taken graduate courses elsewhere. What are the rules for transferring credit?**\n\nThe Graduate School allows students to transfer up to 25% of the curriculum for qualifying graduate courses from other institutions, as long as these courses have not been used to satisfy requirements for a previous degree and the grade is at least a B. In practice this means that two courses (6 credits) could be transferred. Transferred courses may not substitute for required core courses, and core courses may not be waived.\n\nAfter satisfactory completion of at least one semester of full-time registration in the Graduate School, a DSAN student may make a written request for the transfer of credit for specific applicable courses taken (a) at another accredited institution or (b) at Georgetown University prior to admission to DSAN. Requests for transfer of credit must be made in writing through the DSAN Director of Graduate Studies, with a syllabus and transcript attached.\n\n## Internships\n\n**Is there an internship requirement for the degree?**\n\nThere is no internship requirement, but many students seek internship opportunities during the summer.\n\n**Am I guaranteed an internship?**\n\nOur program strives to provide our students with networking opportunities that will assist them in building relationships with companies through career fairs, panel discussions, and seminars. We also regularly share internship opportunities with our students that have been shared with us by many top companies in tech, finance, federal government, etc. However, it is up to each student to apply for internships on their own. In addition, the [Graduate Career Center](https://gradcareer.georgetown.edu/) is a good resource available to all Georgetown graduate students.\n\n**How does an internship actually work?**\n\nAn internship takes place off campus, at a location and in an environment that is not connected to Georgetown University. It could even occur outside of the Washington, DC area. Summer internships are usually full-time and normally last about eight weeks. They may continue into the academic year on a part-time basis. Internships during the academic year are usually part-time. Internships do not carry academic credit.\n\n**Can I get paid for an internship?**\n\nInterns are usually paid for their work. However, there is no guarantee. Keep in mind that the financial benefit of an internship may come later, when you apply for a job and can reference your past experience.\n\n## International Students\n\n_All answers are to the best of current knowledge. They are subject to change and do not constitute legal advice or commitments. Please review our [International Student Resources](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/students/international/) page for detailed information for incoming and current international students._\n\n**Where can I get advice about visa, work restrictions, etc.?**\n\nYour main point of contact is the [International Student and Scholar Services](http://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/) group in the [Office of Global Services](http://globalservices.georgetown.edu/). You will be able to meet with an advisor from that office when you first arrive on campus.\n\n**Is this program of study STEM-eligible?**\n\nYes. International graduates of this program have the opportunity to extend their Optional Practical Training (OPT) from 12 to 24 months, assuming all other requirements are met. The CIP number of this program is 30.3001 (Computational Science).\n\n**Can I take an internship during the summer?**\n\nYes, this is possible. We offer a 0.25 credit course titled _DSAN 5925 -Internship_ that can be taken during the summer which will allow you to apply for CPT. Another option would be to utilize OPT during your internship.\n\n**I plan to go home to visit my family during the summer and will not be able to take a summer course. Will this be a problem?**\n\nNo. The only required summer course will be taken asynchronously online, prior to starting the program in the Fall. Other summer courses will always be electives, and will not be required for graduation.\n\n**Can I become a grader or course assistant?**\n\nYes. International students are eligible for on-campus employment within certain limits.\n\n**Are international students eligible for financial aid?**\n\nYes. International students are always considered for scholarship offers.\n\n## General Questions\n\nYou may wish to review the [Graduate Admissions F.A.Q. page](https://grad.georgetown.edu/admissions/admissions-faq/), which contains useful information about graduate admissions and programs for prospective students.\n\n**Does Georgetown University provide housing for graduate students?**\n\nWhile there is no on-campus housing for graduate students, there is new Georgetown graduate student housing at [55H Street.](https://residentialliving.georgetown.edu/55-h-st-graduate-housing/) The [Office of Neighborhood Life](https://neighborhood.georgetown.edu/georgetown-students/finding-rental/graduate-students/) is a great resource to learn more about off-campus options. There’s also a wealth of housing and student life information on the [Graduate School of Arts & Science’s website](http://grad.georgetown.edu/student-life/life-wash-DC).\n\n**Is there a Georgetown University bus system that students can use?**\n\nYes. It is called [Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle (GUTS)](http://otm.georgetown.edu/guts/) and is free for students and University employees. It serves Dupont Circle, Arlington, Rosslyn, and several other locations.\n\n**Is it possible to have a part-time job while being a full-time student?**\n\nYes. This is something that many graduate students in related fields do, for example after a successful summer internship. International students are eligible for on-campus employment, but their employment opportunities off campus are restricted.\n\n**Is it possible to have a full-time job while being a full-time student?**\n\nStudents are strongly discouraged from doing this. You are putting both your job performance and your academic performance at risk when you attempt this.\n\n**Is there a thesis requirement for the degree?**\n\nNo. There is no thesis requirement.\n\n**Can I write a thesis instead of completing courses?**\n\nThere is currently no thesis option for the degree. However, students may find instructors and work with them on research projects.

    "markdown": "[Faculty Profile](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/announcements/faculty-profile/)\n\n# Dr. James Hickman, Assistant Teaching Professor\n\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-hickman-b869a7b2/)\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/12/Profile-Pics-3x4-4-1.png)\n\n## **Who had the greatest influence on your education and/or career path?**\n\nMany of my beliefs concerning teaching and mentorship stem from my experience as a graduate student. During that time, I was incredibly fortunate to work with Professor Mishin as my Ph.D. advisor at George Mason University. I genuinely believe I couldn’t have asked for a better mentor. I certainly wouldn’t be where I am today without his exceptional guidance, and I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity to work with him.  He demonstrated the importance of intellectual rigor, hard work and discipline, a commitment to high-quality research standards, and, of course, patience for the student’s progress. Furthermore, his extensive knowledge of the current state of academic literature enabled him to select realistic projects for his students that, when completed, were publishable in high-quality journals.\n\n## **With your background in physics, what drew you to data science?**\n\nSeveral factors have shaped my current career trajectory. Broadly speaking, my research falls under the umbrella of computational condensed matter physics, with an emphasis on atomistic modeling and the relationship between crystalline defects and material properties. As a computational physicist, I applied mathematical models and algorithms to simulate physical phenomena, advancing scientific understanding through computer-based analyses. The work draws heavily from thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, solid-state physics, and materials science. It is also interdisciplinary, requiring expertise in various sub-fields of applied mathematics, machine learning, data science, high-performance computing, statistics, and computer science. The simulations I conducted generated substantial amounts of data, all of which needed to be processed, this unintentionally aligned my goals as a physicist with the skills of a data scientist. My research also incorporated various machine learning methodologies, notably in developing accurate models for describing inter-atomic bonding forces in both elemental and multicomponent systems. This involved combining the flexibility of artificial neural networks with the transferability of physically inspired analytic models.\n\nThe plethora of opportunities in data science and machine learning influenced my career shift, along with pragmatic career considerations, and prompted me to recognize the value of integrating data science skills with my experience in the physical sciences.\n\nFinally, my job search coincided with the pandemic, leading to a hiring freeze at most universities, securing my current position was fortuitous, enabling me to diversify my intellectual skill set.\n\n## **What do you enjoy most about your work?**\n\nObserving students move on to promising careers and flourish professionally has been the most rewarding aspect of my teaching experience. I’ve received numerous heartfelt emails from former students, detailing their current positions and expressing gratitude for my role in their success. Teaching can be a difficult job at times, but this positive feedback from students makes it highly rewarding.\n\nAnother fulfilling endeavor is guiding students in research projects, teaching courses can be very time-consuming. In the future, I hope to find more time for research collaborations with students.\n\nFinally, self-education has proven both challenging and rewarding. Each week demands that I push myself to acquire new skills, which is fulfilling. I enjoy the job’s continual opportunity for personal growth.\n\n## **What’s the first piece of advice you would give to a DSAN student?**\n\nThe first piece of advice I would give is to just “know what you are getting into”. Data science is a highly technical, constantly evolving, and interdisciplinary STEM career. The program’s interdisciplinary nature requires students to acquire expertise in various sub-fields of applied mathematics, machine learning, distributed computing, statistics, and computer science.\n\nSecondly, embrace mathematics as an essential and unavoidable skill set. Math is the natural language of all scientific endeavors, and you should strive to become fluent in it. Become as proficient as possible in applied mathematics, particularly in single and multivariable calculus, numerical methods, linear algebra, and statistics. For anyone pursuing a STEM career path, I can guarantee that you won’t regret spending additional time to understand advanced mathematical concepts.\n\nAdditionally, focus on mastering the core programming languages commonly used in data science, particularly R and Python. Do this by (1) focusing on fundamental concepts and packages and (2) attempting hands-on experience by working on real-world projects and applying your skills to solve problems. Balancing theory with practical application will build a robust skill set essential for success in the dynamic and rapidly evolving field of data science.\n\n## **What would people be surprised to learn about you?**\n\nI was a class clown in high school and won the “most talkative” award for my year’s class.\n\n## **What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?**\n\nI’m not sure that there was ever a single instance of optimal advice received. But an aggregation of important advice from parents, friends, grandparents, mentors, and siblings seems to be the following. Work hard, but not so hard that you are unable to enjoy life, attack problems at a fundamental level, be honest with yourself and others, and finally “do unto others as you would have them do unto you”.\n\n## **If you could have one superpower, what would it be and why?**\n\nInterdimensional space-and-time travel. It would be fun and insightful to explore the universe spatially and temporally, as well as to check in on how alternate timelines of reality are doing.\n\n## **What 3 things would you want with you on a deserted island?**\n\nAssuming a long-range radio to contact the outside world and establish a rescue is out of the question. Then a high-quality multi-tool, a reliable fire starter, and a metal pot with a screw-on lid for boiling and storing water.",

    "markdown": "![Decorative Image](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/11/Pharma-Header--scaled.jpg)\n\n[Blog Posts](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/category/blog-posts/)\n\n# The Data Scientist’s Guide to a Career in Pharma\n\n![Parsa Keyvani Byline and Bitmoji](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/11/Blog-Headers-Parsa.png)\n\n## **Skills, Trends, and Opportunities**\n\nWant to make an impact in the healthcare world with your data science skills? The pharmaceutical and biotech industries are full of opportunities to do just that. We will start by taking a broad look at the global demand for data scientists in this space, then dive into specific roles and how to find the best fit for your skills. I’ll also share my own experience as a research and development data scientist intern at a major pharmaceutical company, along with practical tips to help you land a role in this field.\n\n### **Section 1: Data Science Demand by Industry: A Big-Picture Market Overview**\n\nThe chart below shows the demand for data scientists across various industries. While Information Technology leads the way with 87% of total job ads, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector also shows a strong demand for data scientists. This industry uses data scientists to create predictive models on the molecular and clinical data that help in drug discovery and drug trials. Data scientists are also needed in the market side of the business where they analyze the market, discover potential customers, and target advertising to them.\n\n![Glassdoor data on job ads by industry](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/11/Pharma-Careers-Glassdoor.png)\n\n### **Section 2: Climbing the Ladder: Career Growth for Data Scientists in Pharma**\n\n![Career Ladder Flowchart for Data Scientists in Pharma](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/11/Pharma-Blog-Image-2.png)\n\nThe career journey for data scientists in the pharmaceutical industry typically begins with individual contributor roles, such as Analyst or Associate, focused on hands-on data work and model development. After building a solid foundation, data scientists often advance to management positions, where they begin overseeing projects and teams in roles like Manager, Senior Manager, and Group Manager. From here, the path branches into two leadership tracks. The Management Leadership Track emphasizes team management, with levels like Director, Senior Director, and Vice President. Alternatively, the IC Leadership Track allows data scientists to focus on high-impact technical contributions, advancing through roles like Staff, Principal, Distinguished, and Fellow. Each path offers unique opportunities for growth, allowing data scientists to make significant contributions whether they choose a people-focused or technical leadership role.\n\n### **Section 3: Exploring Data Science Roles in the Pharmaceutical Sector**\n\nData scientists in pharma and biotech work across various departments, each with distinct tasks and skill requirements. Understanding these differences can help you identify the best fit for your strengths and career goals.\n\n#### **The Research & Development Data Scientist**\n\n![Skills Needed Image for R & D data scientist](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/11/Pharma-Blog-Skills-Needed.png)\n\nR&D data scientists (RDDS) bridge academia and industry, focusing on core research tasks like designing enzymes, drugs, and microbes. They primarily work with experimental data from labs and often possess a strong background in a relevant scientific field. Advanced machine learning skills are essential, along with creativity for innovation. RDDS typically work within Jupyter Notebooks, focusing on research rather than software development practices, and social skills are beneficial but not critical.\n\n#### **The Application Data Scientist**\n\n![Application Scientist Skills Needed Chart](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/11/Pharma-Skills-Needed-2.png)\n\nApplication data scientists (APDS) address practical business needs, working in agile teams to develop data products for internal or external users. These roles are often department-specific, like quality control, and benefit from domain expertise. APDS professionals engage frequently with stakeholders to adapt to changing requirements, so strong communication skills are key to success in this collaborative environment.\n\n#### **The Generalist Data Scientist**\n\n![Generalist Data Scientist Skills Chart](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/11/Pharma-Skills-Needed-3.png)\n\nGeneralist data scientists (GDS) are often part of central digital or IT departments, supporting various functions across the company. They work on diverse projects—marketing, finance, customer service—requiring them to adapt quickly to different domains without deep expertise in each. Communication and networking skills are vital, enabling GDS professionals to build partnerships and facilitate cross-functional collaboration.\n\n### **Section 4: My Journey as a Data Science Intern in a Major Pharmaceutical Company**\n\nDuring my internship as a Research & Development Data Scientist at Johnson & Johnson, our team’s primary focus was preparing clinical data for analysis to support drug development. We ingested raw clinical data into a large database, standardized it according to FDA standards (STDM & ADAM), and created common data models for researchers and scientists. This role fit the Research & Development Data Scientist profile, where specialized data science supports core scientific research. The team was divided into backend developers, who handled data ingestion and mappings, and frontend developers, who built internal applications allowing users to request data and view summary statistics. A product manager coordinated between the teams, gathering user needs and ensuring timely delivery.\n\n#### **My Tips on Getting Hired as a Data Scientist in Pharma**\n\n1. **Build relevant experience** at Georgetown before applying for pharma or biotech roles. Without prior experience in healthcare or health-related data, it can be very difficult to secure a role in this field. Since I had none, I decided to join a Multiple Myeloma project as a research assistant at Georgetown. This hands-on experience in the field was instrumental in helping me secure my internship.\n2. **Identify your preferred role and department** based on your skills and interests (referencing the categories above). This approach not only increases your chances of securing a role but ensures you’ll enjoy and excel in the position.\n3. **Leverage DSAN resources** like the Professional Development Center to enhance your resume and practice interview skills.\n4. **Target companies you genuinely admire**—while pharma companies may have similar goals, each has its own values and culture. Networking with employees can provide firsthand insights into their work environment.\n5. **Be persistent and proactive.** Keep an eye on job openings and apply consistently. For example, I submitted over 20 applications to Johnson & Johnson before receiving an internship offer.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n[A Complete Guide to a Data Science Career](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-data-scientist-career-path)\n\n[Novo Nordisk AI and Analytics Centre of Excellence](https://medium.com/novo-nordisk-ai-and-analytics-centre-of-excellence/data-science-roles-in-the-pharmaceutical-and-biotechnology-industries-479f1c2dc138)",
