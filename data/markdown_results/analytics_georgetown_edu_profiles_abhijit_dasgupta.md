# Abhijit Dasgupta

- Adjunct Professor

Abhijit Dasgupta is an Adjunct Professor in the Data Science and Analytics program at Georgetown University. He has co-led the development of the Advanced Data Visualization (DSAN 5200, formerly ANLY 503) class and co-teaches the Big Data and Cloud Computing (DSAN 6000, formerly ANLY 502) class. In Fall 2024, he will be teaching Biological and Biomedical Data Science (DSAN 6150). He has been on the faculty since 2020.

Most of Abhijitâ€™s career has been allied with understanding the etiology, risk factors, biomarkers and treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases, and using data science to do it. This often means looking at high-dimensional data and extracting meaningful insights from it, aligned with good study design and biological and clinical domain knowledge. Living at the intersection of computational biology, statistics, and ML/AI. Ironic for someone who learned statistics to avoid biology!

Abhijit received his PhD in Biostatistics from the highly-ranked University of Washington in Seattle, and continued postdoctoral training at the National Cancer Institute, where he worked on biostatistical and bioinformatics analyses in cancer research. Abhijit has broad expertise in statistics and machine learning methods, data analytics, data visualization, operations research, clinical trials and signal processing. In his daily work, he emphasizes sound statistical practice, modern computer-driven analyses, _in silico_ experimentation and simulation for understanding and validation, good coding practice and good communication.

Abhijit is an expert and evangelist in using R and Python for data science, having over 25 years experience in R and 15 years in Python. Abhijit co-founded Statistical Programming DC and served on the board of Data Community DC, an organization that promotes Data Science and Analytics practitioners in the Washington DC Metro area. Abhijit has worked as a data scientist for academia, government and industry, currently developing ML and Bayesian analytic methods, designing studies and analytic plans for biomarker discovery, and promoting better ways of working to support Oncology R&D at AstraZeneca in Gaithersburg, Maryland, as well as providing training and community leadership among R users in the AstraZeneca and pharmaceutical communities.

In addition to his academic and industry work, Abhijit has long served as a member of Data Safety Monitoring Boards for the National Institute of Mental Health, and serves as a reviewer on NIH grant review committees for SBIR and Early Stage Investigator programs.

Outside of his professional life, Abhijit is a 4th degree black belt in aikido (30 years experience) and enjoys time with his family and golden retriever Jingle.
