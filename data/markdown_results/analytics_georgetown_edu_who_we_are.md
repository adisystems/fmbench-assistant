# Who We Are

## Overview

**In the Data Science and Analytics (DSAN) program, we believe that true data scientists make a difference by using data to build a bridge to a better world.**

The Data Science and Analytics Master’s program provides students with rigorous training in analytical, computational, mathematical, and statistical methods and models to prepare them for careers in data science and analytics. Students are provided with opportunities to create stories and visualizations around real-world data sets and current issues facing our world.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

To step forward into the future we must ensure that ALL people are able to move forward with us.

We are committed to nurturing a diverse community and fostering an environment of inclusivity. We are continually working on building and supporting a culture that aligns with these values.

We will continue to learn and grow with compassion and dedication along with our campus community and strive to safeguard our community from the effects of racism, bias, discrimination, and misconduct of any kind.

## Professional Development

Whether a student has just finished college or has spent several years in the workforce, our goal is to prepare them to move forward in their careers after graduation. It is with this goal in mind that we strive to provide opportunities for our students to network, learn job-searching skills, and get the inside scoop on new avenues to employ their skills.
