> Without the DSAN Military Scholarship, I would not have been able to pursue my academic interests at an elite university. This opportunity is invaluable to me, as it enables me to expand my network and engage with esteemed professors and students who are highly knowledgeable in data science. Without this financial support, I doubt I could have accessed the same quality of connections and opportunities. I am particularly excited to delve into analytical time-series techniques and explore their real- world applications. My primary interest lies in the field of finance, and I am eager to apply the knowledge I gain to make meaningful contributions in my future endeavors.

Hanna Born, 2nd Lt US Air Force, 2020 Scholar

> I am incredibly grateful to Georgetown University and the Data Science and Analytics program for their generosity and trust in supporting active-duty service members. The program provides a one-of-a-kind learning opportunity while also fostering civ-mil relations between our two professions. Matriculating in a renowned civilian institution led by incredible and supportive faculty and engaging with extraordinary classmates from every corner of the globe has enabled me to view real world problems through a different prism, providing the skill sets necessary to confront future challenges posed by a rapidly changing world.  I believe that I and other service members privileged enough to attend Georgetown’s DSAN program will broaden our horizons and return to serve our nation greatly enriched, more globally aware and better prepared to make a difference.
