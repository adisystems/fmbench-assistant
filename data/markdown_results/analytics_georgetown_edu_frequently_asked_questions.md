## Preparing for Your Degree

**How much mathematics coursework should I have to be successful in this program?**

Students who apply should have taken Calculus I & II at the college level. It is also essential to have taken a full course in multivariable (vector) calculus and done well in it (B or better). Linear algebra is highly desirable but not required. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to contact the program.

**How much experience with statistics should I have to be successful in this program?**

Applicants should have taken a calculus-based statistics course that covers elementary probability, properties of random variables, common discrete and continuous distributions, expectations, the central limit theorem, parameter estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and possibly elements of linear regression. It is desirable if you have used a computational statistics package in this class, for example SPSS, R, or Stata. If you have taken the first course of a statistics sequence for economics majors (the second course would then be econometrics), you may also be adequately prepared. If you have questions, please [contact the program](mailto:gradanalytics@georgetown.edu?subject=I%20have%20a%20question%20about%20my%20statistics%20preparation).

**How much computer science experience should I have to be successful in this program?**

R and Python are used extensively throughout the program. R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, and Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Students should have working experience or have taken coursework on these languages prior to admission. In addition, introductory computer science coursework focusing on C++ and/or Java will help familiarize students with general programming.

**I haven’t taken a programming course in college, but I became proficient with programming languages while working for my current employer and am now spending most of my time coding in that language. How should I document my computer science proficiency?**

Although we prefer live (classroom-based) courses, you can take an online certificate program in R or Python and upload the certificate with your application to demonstrate proficiency. You can also ask a supervisor to submit a letter of recommendation in which your coding work could be addressed.

**I expect to have some time available before I enter the program this Fall. How can I better prepare during the summer?**

The Georgetown Data Science & Analytics program gives an online course in programming preparation that covers R, Python, and command line use in the summer prior to matriculation. The course is equivalent to three credits, is designed for matriculating MS Data Science & Analytics students, and is offered free of charge. It is required for all incoming students. This course runs during the Georgetown Summer Session. Students must complete this course to matriculate in the fall. It is not an intro course, and assumes at least a basic level of proficiency in R and Python. If you do not have a basic knowledge of both languages, we highly recommend taking some online courses before taking our summer online course.

**I have only taken Calculus I and Calculus II. Can I get admitted to this program?**

You can take our required courses at a local college before applying. Many community colleges offer these courses at convenient times. If you are unable to take a classroom-based course, the next best thing is to take a certificate course online. We’re happy to work with you to prepare a plan. You should also refresh your calculus knowledge before enrolling in our required courses.

**I don’t have any programming experience. Can I get admitted to this program?**

You can acquire this experience in a number of ways, including college courses, online certificates, and and company training. We expect applicants to have a basic knowledge of both R and Python. A good place to start is our list of suggested [resources for completing the prerequisites](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/how-to-apply/#resources-for-completing-prerequisites).

**I am currently taking prerequisite coursework to fulfill program admission requirements. Can I apply for admission before I have completed the course(s) and be admitted to this program?**

Although you are permitted to apply without the prerequisites, you should be aware that you will be competing against applicants who have already completed the prerequisite courses and can provide final grades for them. If you are taking prerequisite coursework when you apply, please indicate on your application that these courses are “in-progress.” When you have completed the courses, please be sure to upload a new transcript reflecting the course grades.

**I have not taken one or more prerequisite courses. Can I take these classes over the summer before Fall classes begin?**

Although you are permitted to apply without the prerequisites, you should be aware that you will be competing against applicants who have already completed the prerequisite courses and can provide final grades for them. So while you have a chance of being admitted if the rest of your application is strong, your application will not be as competitive as those who have already completed the required courses. You would have a much better chance of being admitted if you complete all prerequisites before applying. A good place to start is our suggested list of [resources for completing the prerequisites](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/how-to-apply/#resources-for-completing-prerequisites).

**I took Econometrics in college, and we did a good deal of statistics in that course. Am I prepared adequately?**

This preparation is usually sufficient. To make sure, please send us more detail about your preparation, including perhaps a syllabus or information about the textbook that was used.

**Is there a minimum GPA for applicants?**

The Graduate School expects a B-average (3.0 or better) for applicants. We want to make sure that entering students can meet or come close to this requirement. For a successful application, evidence of success in advanced mathematics, statistics and/or computer science courses is even more important. If the application shows this, a student with a slightly lower GPA may still have a chance of admission.

## Financial Questions

**What kind of financial assistance is available for students?**

The Data Science & Analytics program offers merit-based scholarships to both incoming and continuing students. There are also opportunities for student employment as a research assistant or teaching assistant. You can learn about how assistantships work by visiting the [Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Financial Support](http://grad.georgetown.edu/financial-support) page. As a returning student in your second year, you will be eligible to compete for a [merit-based scholarship](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/returning-scholarships/).

**What other possibilities are there for student employment?**

There are Research Assistant (RA) and Teaching Assistant (TA) opportunities on campus. Assistantships are generally awarded to continuing students who have performed well academically. These positions are usually found through word-of-mouth or via [Georgetown’s Student Employment Office](https://seo.georgetown.edu/JobX_FindAJob.aspx?t=qs&qs=21); you need a NetID to log in, which can be found in your offer letter.

**Will I receive an automatic offer of financial assistance when I get admitted?**

Our scholarships are merit-based and are not determined based on financial need. _**All applicants**_ are considered for merit-based scholarships.

**If I don’t receive an offer for a scholarship upon admission, will I have another chance once I am enrolled?**

As a returning student in your second year, you will be eligible to compete for a [merit-based scholarship](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/returning-scholarships/).

## Course Planning

**How many courses can I take at a time?**

Three courses per semester is the normal load for full time students. Part-time students who also have a full-time job may take either one or two courses per semester. Working full time and taking three graduate courses is not recommended.

**Can I be a part-time student?**

Yes. This is possible for students who are not on a student visa. This may be a good option for students who wish to continue their full-time job while attending the program, especially if they receive financial support from their employer. Graduate School rules state that students admitted to a master’s degree program are allowed three years from matriculation to complete all requirements for the degree.

**Is it possible to switch between part-time and full-time status?**

Yes. It is possible to switch back and forth between full-time and part-time status, and many students do this depending on their desired balance of work and study. However, international students must remain on full-time status throughout and may only switch to part-time status during their last semester. In addition, students should keep in mind that they are required to complete the program within three calendar years.

**Do graduate students have academic advisors?**

Yes. Individual advising is available to all graduate students.

**Does the program offer graduate courses during the summer?**

Yes, the Data Science & Analytics program typically offers one to two classes during summer semester. Students may also take coursework from other programs to satisfy elective requirements during the summer.

**When and where will classes be offered?**

All classes will be offered on Georgetown University’s Main Campus. View directions to the [Main Campus](https://www.georgetown.edu/plan-your-visit/#visiting-main-campus) and [campus maps](http://maps.georgetown.edu/). Classes in this program usually meet one day per week, often in the late afternoon (3:30 – 6:00pm) or evening (6:30 – 9:00pm), although we also offer morning classes.

**How easy is it to take courses in other programs or departments?**

The Data Science and Analytics program offers a large number of elective classes tailored specifically toward our students, so we highly recommend that you select electives within our program! However, if you have a specialized interest, you can talk to us about taking an elective class in another department if it is relevant to your degree.

**Is it possible to take courses out of sequence?**

We strongly recommend against it. The curriculum has been carefully designed to maximize your experience and your performance.

**How often are the core and elective courses offered?**

The required core courses and the elective courses are offered every year. DSAN-5000: Introduction to Data Analytics is always offered in the Fall.

**What is the typical number of students in a graduate class?**

The class size will typically be capped at 25-35, but classes will also run with smaller sizes.

**Will I be able to get a seat in the course I want to take?**

You will always be able to get a seat in core Data Science & Analytics courses. Popular electives in the Data Science & Analytics program sometimes fill to capacity, but this is rare.

**Can I take elective courses before completing the core courses?**

Yes. This is possible, and you are encouraged to do so. Be sure to check the prerequisites of any course that you wish to take.

**I have taken graduate courses elsewhere. What are the rules for transferring credit?**

The Graduate School allows students to transfer up to 25% of the curriculum for qualifying graduate courses from other institutions, as long as these courses have not been used to satisfy requirements for a previous degree and the grade is at least a B. In practice this means that two courses (6 credits) could be transferred. Transferred courses may not substitute for required core courses, and core courses may not be waived.

After satisfactory completion of at least one semester of full-time registration in the Graduate School, a DSAN student may make a written request for the transfer of credit for specific applicable courses taken (a) at another accredited institution or (b) at Georgetown University prior to admission to DSAN. Requests for transfer of credit must be made in writing through the DSAN Director of Graduate Studies, with a syllabus and transcript attached.

## Internships

**Is there an internship requirement for the degree?**

There is no internship requirement, but many students seek internship opportunities during the summer.

**Am I guaranteed an internship?**

Our program strives to provide our students with networking opportunities that will assist them in building relationships with companies through career fairs, panel discussions, and seminars. We also regularly share internship opportunities with our students that have been shared with us by many top companies in tech, finance, federal government, etc. However, it is up to each student to apply for internships on their own. In addition, the [Graduate Career Center](https://gradcareer.georgetown.edu/) is a good resource available to all Georgetown graduate students.

**How does an internship actually work?**

An internship takes place off campus, at a location and in an environment that is not connected to Georgetown University. It could even occur outside of the Washington, DC area. Summer internships are usually full-time and normally last about eight weeks. They may continue into the academic year on a part-time basis. Internships during the academic year are usually part-time. Internships do not carry academic credit.

**Can I get paid for an internship?**

Interns are usually paid for their work. However, there is no guarantee. Keep in mind that the financial benefit of an internship may come later, when you apply for a job and can reference your past experience.

## International Students

_All answers are to the best of current knowledge. They are subject to change and do not constitute legal advice or commitments. Please review our [International Student Resources](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/students/international/) page for detailed information for incoming and current international students._

**Where can I get advice about visa, work restrictions, etc.?**

Your main point of contact is the [International Student and Scholar Services](http://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/) group in the [Office of Global Services](http://globalservices.georgetown.edu/). You will be able to meet with an advisor from that office when you first arrive on campus.

**Is this program of study STEM-eligible?**

Yes. International graduates of this program have the opportunity to extend their Optional Practical Training (OPT) from 12 to 24 months, assuming all other requirements are met. The CIP number of this program is 30.3001 (Computational Science).

**Can I take an internship during the summer?**

Yes, this is possible. We offer a 0.25 credit course titled _DSAN 5925 -Internship_ that can be taken during the summer which will allow you to apply for CPT. Another option would be to utilize OPT during your internship.

**I plan to go home to visit my family during the summer and will not be able to take a summer course. Will this be a problem?**

No. The only required summer course will be taken asynchronously online, prior to starting the program in the Fall. Other summer courses will always be electives, and will not be required for graduation.

**Can I become a grader or course assistant?**

Yes. International students are eligible for on-campus employment within certain limits.

**Are international students eligible for financial aid?**

Yes. International students are always considered for scholarship offers.

## General Questions

You may wish to review the [Graduate Admissions F.A.Q. page](https://grad.georgetown.edu/admissions/admissions-faq/), which contains useful information about graduate admissions and programs for prospective students.

**Does Georgetown University provide housing for graduate students?**

While there is no on-campus housing for graduate students, there is new Georgetown graduate student housing at [55H Street.](https://residentialliving.georgetown.edu/55-h-st-graduate-housing/) The [Office of Neighborhood Life](https://neighborhood.georgetown.edu/georgetown-students/finding-rental/graduate-students/) is a great resource to learn more about off-campus options. There’s also a wealth of housing and student life information on the [Graduate School of Arts & Science’s website](http://grad.georgetown.edu/student-life/life-wash-DC).

**Is there a Georgetown University bus system that students can use?**

Yes. It is called [Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle (GUTS)](http://otm.georgetown.edu/guts/) and is free for students and University employees. It serves Dupont Circle, Arlington, Rosslyn, and several other locations.

**Is it possible to have a part-time job while being a full-time student?**

Yes. This is something that many graduate students in related fields do, for example after a successful summer internship. International students are eligible for on-campus employment, but their employment opportunities off campus are restricted.

**Is it possible to have a full-time job while being a full-time student?**

Students are strongly discouraged from doing this. You are putting both your job performance and your academic performance at risk when you attempt this.

**Is there a thesis requirement for the degree?**

No. There is no thesis requirement.

**Can I write a thesis instead of completing courses?**

There is currently no thesis option for the degree. However, students may find instructors and work with them on research projects. Such research may then lead to publishable papers.
