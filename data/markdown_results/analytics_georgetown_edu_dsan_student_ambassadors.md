## Dominic Vogel

I am a second-year DSAN student, part of the Accelerated MS DSAN program, with a bachelor’s degree in Finance and Operations & Analytics from Georgetown University. This is my second year as a student ambassador, so I can be a great resource for any program related information. In my free time, I love supporting Minnesota sports teams, listening to new music, going for runs, and playing competitive Pokemon. You can find me behind the front desk of the DSAN suite if you have any questions about the program or just want to chat!

## Shanay Wadhwani

I’m a first year student in the DSAN program. I grew up in Mumbai, India and studied at Hamilton College, NY. Ever since I can remember, I’ve been fascinated with computers and the ever-increasing power of the compute technology around us. This cutting edge field has so many applications which GU allows its students to access, gain experience in, and even master. It is also forever evolving and I try my best to stay abreast of new developments in the field. In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer, chess, reading Russian literature or any fiction I can get my hands on, and cooking some simple foods. I’m always happy to connect and talk data!
