She is also a faculty affiliated with Massive Data Institute and Department of Mathematics and Statistics to teach the data mining course at Georgetown. Before joining Georgetown in 2023, Dr. He has been a Senior Research Scientist in the Advanced Psychometric and Data Science Modeling Center at Educational Testing Service (ETS) for over nine years, overseeing research on adaptive measurement modeling, innovative item type development, technology-based environment design, and sequential process data analyses in national and international large-scale assessments such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) as well as in K-12 education assessments and learning projects. Dr. He was appointed as OECD Thomas J. Alexander Fellow in 2018 and has been serving on the Psychometrics and Educational Evaluation Panel for UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) and Policy Linking Panel for USAID since 2020. She also serves on the Board of Trustees in International Psychometric Society, the Executive Board of American Psychological Association (Division 5: Quantitative and Qualitative Research Methods) and co-chairs the Big Data SIGMIE in the National Council on Measurement in Education. In addition, Dr. He was an Adjunct Professor in Methodology Inquiry Program at the College of Education in Indiana University Bloomington in 2022.

Dr. He’s research focuses on advancing methodologies in sequence data mining, text mining, psychometric modeling, and machine learning on new data sources (e.g., process data, textual data, and behavioral data from virtual reality) collected in innovative digital-based assessments in education, psychology, psychiatry and public health, to better measure individual's latent trait and track people's problem-solving strategies. Dr. He also expertises in interactive item design for personalized learning assessments, collaborative problem solving, adaptive measurement and manages to bridge the findings in statistical modeling to education policy and curriculum reform. Dr. He has been leading multiple research projects funded by National Science Foundation (NSF), Institute of Educational Sciences (IES), International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES), American Institute for Research (AIR) and OECD in developing innovative methods to analyze complex new data sources (e.g., process data and textual data) in education that have the potential to understand students' learning behaviors and strategies thus to assist in improving students' achievement, especially for the underrepresented groups. Dr. He was the recipient of the Annual Award of Exceptional Achievement in 2023, the Jason Millman Promising Measurement Scholar Award in 2019, and the Alicia Cascallar Outstanding Paper of Early-Career Scholar Award in 2017 from the National Council on Measurement in Education and the winner of Exemplary Paper Award in Adult Literacy and Education from the American Educational Research Association in 2023.

In addition, Dr. He has been selected as ad-hoc grant reviewer fro NSF and IES in innovative data mining methods for many years and seated in the NSF grant panel of Graduate Research Fellowship Program since 2019. She currently serves on the editorial board of the _Journal of Educational Measurement_ and _Zeitschrift für Psychologie_ and is the Lead Guest Editor for the _Journal of Intelligence_. Dr. He serves as an ad hoc reviewer for over 30 journals in the fields of education and psychology, including the top-ranking journals such as _Computers and Education_, _Psychological Methods_ and _Psychometrika_.

Dr. He obtained her doctoral degree Ph.D. in Psychometrics and Data Science from the University of Twente, in the Netherlands in 2013. Her dissertation entitled "Text Mining and IRT for Psychiatric and Psychological Assessments" won the prestigious Dutch Abbas Foundation Best Dissertation Award in Psychology in 2013 and Outstanding Dissertation Award in American Psychological Association Division 5 in 2017.
