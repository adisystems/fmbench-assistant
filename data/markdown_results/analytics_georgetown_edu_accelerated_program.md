## Application Deadlines

**Fall Admission: February 15**

Applications for the accelerated program and **all** **supporting materials must be received by February 15 to receive consideration.** (Georgetown students only)

**Spring Admission: October 1**

Applications for the accelerated program and **all** **supporting materials must be received by October 1 to receive consideration for Spring admission.** (Georgetown students only)

The _Accelerated DSAN Master’s Program_ is for Georgetown undergraduate students only.

- This program enables Georgetown undergrads to complete a BS (or BA) in an appropriate area, to take the needed prerequisites during their undergraduate degree, to take two (2) Data Science and Analytics (DSAN) graduate classes as _general electives_ during their senior year, and then to join the MS in DSAN Program to complete their MS degree in DSAN. Therefore, these two DSAN graduate classes will count toward both the students’ BS (BA) and toward the MS.
- This option **saves both time and money**, allows students to graduate with a Bachelor’s degree AND a Master of Science degree in Data Science and Analytics in 5 years (accelerated), and will advance academic and industry potential.
- **Prerequisites**: Calc I, II, Probability & Statistics (or equivalent such as econometrics, etc.), programming R, Python, or C++ (Python is recommended). Interested students should assure completion of these classes during their undergraduate degree. There are many options for these prerequisites. For example, statistics, math stats, prob & stats, econometrics, etc. are all considered “statistics” and will meet the requirement.

- **Students should apply to the _Accelerated DSAN Program_ in their junior year.** [Click here for more details on when and how to apply.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ptlfcvFxBsShcwhmbdum5tQ9F0Kw3ctFiJ1RglsJFQU/edit?usp=sharing)

**Steps for Students:**

- Learn about the new program by contacting gradanalytics@georgetown.edu.
- Plan to apply in your junior year.
- Plan to complete the prerequisites: Calc I, II, Probability & Statistics (or equivalent), Programming/CS as noted above. There are many options for these types of classes.
- Apply to the BS(A) – MS DSAN Program
- After acceptance, students will then take any two (2) of the following DSAN graduate class options during their senior year from this list (DSAN 5000, 5100, 5200, 5300). Students will also engage, after their junior year, in our free and online R and Python Programming Bootcamp.
  - Generally, the minimum required GPA for applicants is 3.5, but we consider many criteria.
  - **We DO NOT require the GRE.**
- Students cannot register for any DSAN classes until they apply and are accepted into the Accelerated DSAN Program.
- Students may start the BS(A) – MS Program in Fall or Spring.
- Once students are accepted, complete the above, and graduate with their BS(A), they will then officially become MS students in DSAN and will complete the remaining 8 required DSAN classes.
- Timing: Students may complete the remaining DSAN requirements in 3 terms. If summer is included (per the student’s choice) they can complete the MS in one year.

Details about DSAN 5000, 5100, 5200, and 5300 can be found [here](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/program-overview/course-descriptions/#core-courses).

## **Further Details**

**Prerequisites:** Undergraduate students who elect to apply to the Accelerated DSAN Program and who are accepted will complete the prerequisites during their undergraduate degree.

1. In some cases, such as Math, Statistics, CS, and Economics, such prerequisites are likely part of the standard program. However, for other programs, such as Biology, students will need to specifically take these required requisite classes.
   - There are often many options for classes. For example, Prob & Stats, Statistics, Math Stats, Econometrics, etc. are all considered “statistics.”
2. **Counting Courses Twice – for BS(A) and for MS:** In the Accelerated Program, students are permitted to take DSAN classes that will **count twice – once toward their BS(A) and again toward the MS in DSAN.**
   - Normally, students can take these DSAN graduate classes as general electives.
   - However, ask your undergraduate advising dean if you have the option to take these classes as **major electives (electives toward the major) and not just general electives.** This will offer greater opportunities and flexibility.

     - Math students can take DSAN 5100 instead of MATH 2140; i.e. they can count DSAN 5100 as their math elective instead of MATH 2140, but they cannot get Math credit for both courses.
   - Once students complete their BS (or BA), **they will then officially become graduate students in the MS DSAN Program and will complete all remaining 8 courses for the MS degree.**
   - **You CAN complete the MS in 1 year (12 months) and you can choose to start in Fall or Spring.**
   - **You will participate in the required, free, self-directed and fully online “Programming in R and Python Bootcamp” as all MS students do. This is generally done the summer before you take DSAN 5000.**
3. Generally, the minimum required GPA for applicants is 3.5, but we consider many criteria.
4. **We DO NOT require the GRE.**
