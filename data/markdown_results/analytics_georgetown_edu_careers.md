> **“** In business school I was not exposed high-level technical skills. This program definitely helped me sharpen my technical skills and build knowledge in data science. I learned several computer languages for extensive data manipulation, and gained depth in statistical analysis and predictive modeling. At Deloitte I bring this knowledge to enhance business insights. **“**
