# Degree Requirements

Students in the DSAN program must successfully complete 30 credits and maintain a cumulative GPA of no less than 3.00.

## Data Science and Analytics Coursework

There are five three-credit core courses that are designed to provide students with a solid foundation in data science. We also give a zero-credit programming bootcamp course in the summer prior to matriculation. The additional five three-credit elective courses allow students to learn tailored skills, helping them apply data analysis to fields of interest. Coursework may be taken in any order that is allowed by the prerequisites.

Courses will be offered during the fall semester (late August through early December) and the spring semester (early January through early May). In addition, summer courses may be offered. Courses will typically meet once per week in the late afternoon or early evening.

Students may enroll on a full-time or part-time basis, usually starting in the fall semester of each academic year. Full-time students will be able to complete the degree in 16 calendar months by taking three courses per semester for three semesters, plus a summer course. Students may, however, take up to three years to complete the program, e.g. by taking one or two courses per semester plus summer courses.

The Georgetown DSAN program gives an online course in programming preparation that covers R, Python, and command line use in the summer prior to matriculation. The course is equivalent to three credits, is designed for matriculating MS Data Science & Analytics students, and is offered free of charge. It is required for all incoming students. This course will run during the Georgetown Summer Session (June – August). Students must complete this course to matriculate in the fall.

**\*DSAN accelerated students may double-count (i.e. apply toward both UG and grad degree requirements) only TWO DSAN classes. Any DSAN classes taken during senior year beyond the two double-counted classes are permitted only if the student has earned at least 120 undergraduate credit hours, and will apply toward the MS degree only (NOT the undergraduate degree).**
