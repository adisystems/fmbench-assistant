# International Students

## Admissions

The Office of Global Services (OGS) only processes immigration documents for international students who are fully admitted to Georgetown University. The immigration document request process starts in mid-March for students entering their program in the Fall. New students should carefully follow instructions in their admission letter to request an immigration document.

NOTE: The F-1 or J-1 immigration process to obtain a visa begins only after a student is fully admitted and has confirmed enrollment.

Applicants who attended institutions outside of the United States must submit their transcripts in the form of a course-by-course evaluation using a credential evaluation service that is a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services ( [NACES](https://www.naces.org/)), such as [WES](https://www.wes.org/credential-evaluations/) ICAP or [SpanTran](https://spanside.my.salesforce-sites.com/SpantranApplication?Id=53cc707f-94b3-4a1a-9cdc-3a26e6742adf) Course Analysis. (These evaluations are not a requirement of all programs in the Graduate School, but are required for the Data Science & Analytics Program. **No exceptions will be made.**)

You will not need to send your transcript evaluation to our school at this time; instead, you should ask the evaluation service to send the evaluation directly to you, and then you should upload the evaluation directly to the online application. An official transcript will be required if you are offered admission to the program.

Applicants may use other credential evaluation services that are members of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES) but must still submit official transcripts from the institution to Georgetown if the evaluation does not include an official copy of the transcripts you had evaluated.

> I chose Georgetown because I thought it would cover deeper aspects of data science, and my experience has reflected that. I’m encouraged to think about the “whys” behind what we are doing with statistics, algorithms, and computation to extrapolate to different data science situations.”

## TOEFL Requirements for Non-Native Speakers of English

- Applicants who have not attended an institution of higher education where the primary language of instruction is English and who are not native speakers are also required to demonstrate proficiency in the English language. Non-native speakers must achieve at least a minimum score on either the TOEFL or IELTS.
