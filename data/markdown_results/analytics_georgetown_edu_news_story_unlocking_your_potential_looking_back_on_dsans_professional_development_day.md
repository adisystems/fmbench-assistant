If you missed last Friday’s Professional Development Day, you really missed out! Dr. Purna Gamage, Dr. James Hickman, Dr. Jeff Jacobs, and Dr. Abhijit Dasgupta took time out of their busy schedules to share invaluable insights on applications and job searching.

The day kicked off with a resume-building session led by Dr. Gamage and Dr. Hickman. Dr. Gamage introduced tools like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and how to tailor resumes for specific job descriptions, while Dr. Hickman covered the essentials of resumes and cover letters, sharing personal tips for highlighting key traits of high performers.

Next, we broke into groups for technical and behavioral interview practice. Dr. Hickman and Dr. Dasgupta led technical sessions, providing real-world coding and conceptual problems for us to solve independently before discussing as a group. Their guidance on tackling technical challenges under pressure was incredibly helpful.

On the behavioral side, Dr. Gamage, Dr. Jacobs, and Dr. Dasgupta conducted mock interviews, offering feedback on how to respond to tough questions. Switching between technical and behavioral practice midway through the session allowed everyone to experience both aspects of the interview process. Each professor’s insight was nothing short of impressive.

The day wrapped up with an elevator pitch workshop led by Dr. Dasgupta. He gave helpful advice, emphasized the importance of a memorable pitch, and gave us time to craft and practice our own in small groups. Many students, along with myself, left feeling more confident in their ability to pitch themselves effectively.

I could list all the resources and tips I gained from the event, but there are too many, and honestly, you’d benefit more from attending the next one yourself! DSAN offers so many opportunities to help us succeed—make sure you take advantage before it’s too late!
