This was a multidisciplinary event was a month-long hackathon centered around analyzing parking data from local lots. Initially, the original challenge encouraged participants to create front-end web applications that optimize parking spot selection, but we decided to take a different approach. When we discovered that the Application Programming Interface (API) provided for the event included historical parking data spanning an entire year, we saw an opportunity to explore broader trends.\n\nOver the course of the hackathon, we developed insights into how parking behaviors fluctuate during these times and prepared our findings for presentation at the conference. It enabled us to learn about new models and methods we could utilize on future data challenges.\n\nThere was a considerable amount of people from many different fields of work. Professionals from various fields—software engineers, entrepreneurs, data analysts, consultants, mathematicians, and DevOps specialists—were all in attendance. Specifically, we were surprised at how many people represented their own tech start-ups, and the ambition that came with that.\n\n![Trey and Sophie speak at the Code the Curb Hackathon](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/12/Coding-the-Curb-3.jpg)\n\nAfter our presentation, taking questions, and giving recommendations on how parking can be made more efficient utilizing the previous data collected from the API, a period of networking gave us the chance to talk with the others and those we hadn’t met, to discuss both our projects and our future work. During the Q&A session, we shared recommendations for improving parking efficiency by leveraging the insights gained from historical data. Many were appreciative of our initiative to forefront trend analysis rather than developing a web application. They were also excited to see technical presentations done in a manner that was both professional and fun (shoutout PowerPoint). The subsequent networking period provided a fantastic opportunity to connect with other participants and exchange ideas about future projects and collaborations. Outside of our presentation, we got to learn about how some of the other participants took on the challenge and were very intrigued by many of the creative insights!\n\nOverall, the experience was both enriching and inspiring. Events like these not only push us to think critically and creatively but also foster a sense of community among professionals from diverse backgrounds.",

    "markdown": "# Degree Requirements\n\nStudents in the DSAN program must successfully complete 30 credits and maintain a cumulative GPA of no less than 3.00.\n\n## Data Science and Analytics Coursework\n\nThere are five three-credit core courses that are designed to provide students with a solid foundation in data science. We also give a zero-credit programming bootcamp course in the summer prior to matriculation. The additional five three-credit elective courses allow students to learn tailored skills, helping them apply data analysis to fields of interest. Coursework may be taken in any order that is allowed by the prerequisites.\n\nCourses will be offered during the fall semester (late August through early December) and the spring semester (early January through early May). In addition, summer courses may be offered. Courses will typically meet once per week in the late afternoon or early evening.\n\nStudents may enroll on a full-time or part-time basis, usually starting in the fall semester of each academic year. Full-time students will be able to complete the degree in 16 calendar months by taking three courses per semester for three semesters, plus a summer course. Students may, however, take up to three years to complete the program, e.g. by taking one or two courses per semester plus summer courses.\n\nThe Georgetown DSAN program gives an online course in programming preparation that covers R, Python, and command line use in the summer prior to matriculation. The course is equivalent to three credits, is designed for matriculating MS Data Science & Analytics students, and is offered free of charge. It is required for all incoming students. This course will run during the Georgetown Summer Session (June – August). Students must complete this course to matriculate in the fall.\n\n## Full-Time Course Plan\n\n##### Fall Semester: Year One\n\n| Course Name | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN 5000 Data Science and Analytics (Core Course) | 3 |\n| DSAN 5100 Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Computing (Core Course) | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n\n##### Spring Semester:Year One\n\n| Course Name | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5200: Analytical Data Visualization (Core Course) | 3 |\n| DSAN-5300: Statistical Learning (Core Course) | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n\n##### Summer Semester between Year One and Year Two-Optional\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5925: Internship | .25 |\n\n**OR**\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective(s) | 3 (each) |\n\n##### Fall Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-6000: Big Data and Cloud Computing (Core Course) | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n\n##### Spring Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective | 3 |\n| Internship (Optional) | .25 |\n\nNote: You can graduate sooner by taking your final elective in the fall semester.\n\n## Part-Time Course Plan\n\n#### Fall Semester: Year One\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5000: Data Science and Analytics | 3 |\n| DSAN-5100: Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Computing | 3 |\n\n#### Spring Semester: Year One\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5200: Analytical Data Visualization | 3 |\n| DSAN-5300: Statistical Learning | 3 |\n\n#### Fall Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-6000: Big Data and Cloud Computing | 3 |\n| Elective | 3 |\n\n#### Spring Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective | 3 |\n| Elective | 3 |\n\n#### Fall Semester: Year Three\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective | 3 |\n| Elective | 3 |\n\n**Note: PT DSAN students may take 1 or 2 classes per semester, provided degree requirements are completed within 3 calendar years.

Our classes utilize knowledge of Multivariate Calculus (usually called Calc I and II or sometimes Calc III) and Probability and Statistics (which can be called Math Stats, Econometrics, Regression Analysis, etc.). **Experience with computer programming (such as R, Python, C++, Java, etc). Linear Algebra, while not required, is also very helpful.**\n\nWe love the diversity of experiences our students bring to the program. They come from a very broad and wide range of backgrounds, including economics, marketing, business, computer science, engineering, math, statistics, linguistics, public policy, and others. Accordingly, **it is not uncommon for applicants to be missing one or more prerequisites.** If you are missing any of the prerequisites, or if you want to be better prepared in R, Python, etc. (which is always a smart idea) [we recommend that you fill in gaps via online](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/how-to-apply/#programming-knowledge-resources), local community college, or other similar options.\n\nInclude any certificates that you acquire with your application. If you want to submit by the early deadline and have not yet completed a course (so do not yet have the certificate), list the courses you are taking on your application and email the certificates as soon as you have them to [gradanalytics@georgetown.edu](mailto:gradanalytics@georgetown.edu)\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2024/11/Sofia-LI-Headshot-2.jpeg)\n\n## Meet Our Admissions Counselor\n\nSofia Rosales\n\nDSAN Admissions Counselor\n\nSofia is here to support you through the admissions process and to answer your questions, even the ones you might be hesitant to ask.

    "markdown": "# Course Descriptions\n\n## Core Courses\n\n### Pre-Program Bootcamp: Programming in R and Python\n\nThe Georgetown Data Science & Analytics program gives an online course in programming preparation that covers R, Python, and command line use in the summer prior to matriculation. The course is equivalent to three credits, is designed for matriculating MS Data Science & Analytics students, and is offered free of charge. It is required for all incoming students. This course will run during the Georgetown Summer Session (May – August). Students must complete this course to matriculate in the fall.\n\n### DSAN 5000: Data Science and Analytics\n\nThis course introduces students to several core data science concepts. It teaches students how to synthesize disparate, possibly unstructured data to better understand and characterize the world, and in some cases, to draw meaningful inferences. Topics covered include: the history of data science, successes and failures in data analytics, the data analytics life cycle, data/web scraping and APIs, data wrangling, data characterization (correlations, identifying clusters and associations), data inference and basic machine learning, network analysis, data ethics, and visual analytics. Students will work on a semester-long data science project that starts with question formulation and data collection, and goes through all the stages of the life cycle, culminating in data storytelling. The course also maps data science case studies to topics presented throughout the semester. _Prerequisites: Intermediate coding experience in Python3, and knowledge of introductory statistics. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5100: Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Computing\n\nProbabilistic models are essential for the understanding of data that are affected by uncertainty. This course introduces students to the fundamentals of probabilistic modeling and then covers computational techniques for the analysis of such data. After introducing basic concepts and approaches such as probability distributions, random variables, and conditioning, the course covers basic probability distributions that are frequently used in practice and some of their properties, such as Laws of Large Numbers. In the second half, students will learn about computational techniques for the use of probabilistic models. This includes methods for faithful simulation of random variables (Monte Carlo), the extraction of condensed models from observed data (maximum likelihood, Bayesian models), methods for models with hidden or partially observed variables (latent variables, expectation-maximization, hidden Markov models), and some general data science techniques that incorporate probabilistic models (graphical models, stochastic optimization). _Prerequisites: Introductory statistics, some coding experience (e.g. R). 3 credits. **Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5200: Advanced Data Visualization\n\nPresenting quantitative information in visual form is an essential communication skill for data professionals. This course introduces representation methods and visualization techniques for complex data, drawing on insights from cognitive science and graphic design. Students will obtain an overview of the human visual system, learn to use models for data and for images, and acquire good design practices, such as those using the “grammar of graphics.” Students will use common statistical design tools such as graphic methods in Python3, interactive graphic methods such as Bokeh, Leaflet, and NetworkD3, the R package ggplot2, and Tableau. _Prerequisites: DSAN 5000. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5300: Statistical Learning\n\nStatistical Learning is concerned with algorithms that use statistical techniques to find structure or patterns in given data (unsupervised learning) or use given instances of data to predict outcomes in new cases (supervised learning). A well-known method of this type is linear regression, and this will be covered early in the course. Statistical methods for making discrete predictions (classification) such as logistic regression will also be covered. Special emphasis will be placed on techniques for handling high-dimensional data (i.e. instances with many attributes), including variable selection and dimension reduction. The course will also cover ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting that are often used to improve the results of given classification methods. Unsupervised methods covered in this course include model-based and hierarchical clustering. _Prerequisites: DSAN 5100. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6000: Big Data and Cloud Computing\n\nToday’s data scientists are commonly faced with huge data sets (Big Data) that may arrive at fantastic rates and in a broad variety of formats. This core course addresses the resulting challenges. The course will introduce students to the advantages and limitations of distributed computing and to methods of assessing its impact. Techniques for parallel processing (MapReduce) and their implementation (Hadoop) will be covered, as well as techniques for accessing unstructured data and for handling streaming data. These techniques will be applied to real world examples, using clusters of computational cores and cloud computing. _Prerequisite: Working knowledge of Python and the Unix command line, some knowledge of data structures and DSAN 5000. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n## Elective Courses\n\n### DSAN 5400: Computational Linguistics – Advanced Python\n\nThis course presents topics in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Python programming. The goal of this class is to explore techniques in NLP, with a strong emphasis on hands-on instruction that progressively matures basic Python users into expert Python developers. We will examine topics such as text classification, model evaluation, machine translation, and distributed representations. Throughout the semester, students will select and read a book on AI ethics to motivate discussions on the social impact of modern NLP technologies. Applications include authorship identification, retrieval, and textual similarity, to name a few.\n\nAbout half of the total class time is devoted to addressing an essential but often neglected piece in software development education: moving from typical data science programming workflows (such as writing basic scripts) to developing sophisticated Python projects. In other words, students will learn to design professional-grade software that they and others will be proud to contribute to together. Programming topics are explored in great depth, including Python best practices, object-oriented design, project structuring, and more. This class will give students the skills they need to contribute to the professional software repositories they work with already and even develop their own. _3 credits_. _**Offered in the Fall and Spring semesters.**_\n\n### DSAN 5450: Data Ethics and Policy\n\nThis graduate-level course will train students to navigate the landscape of ethical issues which inevitably arise, across a variety of fields and industries, in each step of the data science process. Students will explore and critically evaluate a range of data-related issues in contemporary society, such as responsible data collection, algorithmic bias, privacy, transparency, accountability, democratic participation in data usage and data-driven decisions, and the ethical implications of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning (self-driving cars, ChatGPT, crowd-sourced training data, etc.).\n\nThrough a combination of theoretical discussions and real-world case studies, students will examine the profound public policy and social issues associated with data ethics. This course will empower students by introducing a set of general ethical frameworks (consequentialism, deontological ethics, and virtue ethics) and discussing their relative strengths and weaknesses in terms of their ability to address modern ethical dilemmas and guide ethical decision-making processes in business, healthcare, government, and academia. These theoretical frameworks will then be discussed in light of more practical regulatory and policy considerations, so that students will have the tools they need to draw conclusions (in the form of their final projects) about best practices for data handling within a particular field or topic of interest to them.\n\nThe course will thus equip students with a robust ethical “toolbox” for conscientiously gathering, interpreting, and extracting meaning from data while respecting privacy, fairness, transparency, democratic accountability, and other social concerns. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5500: Data Structures, Objects, and Algorithms in Python\n\nThe  Data Structures, Objects, and Algorithms in Python course will look at built-in data structures, such as dictionaries, lists, tuples, sets, strings, and frozen sets. The course will also cover objects and classes in Python, as well as building new structures and objects. The class will cover algorithms including runtime, recurrence, and development. Applications will include data science problems. _Prerequisite: A working or intermediate knowledge of Python. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5550: Data Science and Climate Change\n\nData Science, as a key component of Artificial Intelligence, is helping shape profound changes to society.  An equally forceful phenomenon affecting our world is climate change.  This course will investigate the myriad ways Data Science can be used to address climate change.  This will include aspects of climate change which Data Science is already beginning to tackle, such as mitigating emissions from the five most carbon-intensive societal activities – energy, manufacturing, agriculture / land use, transportation, and buildings / infrastructure.  We will also look at Data Science’s emerging role in areas such as climate modeling, biodiversity conservation, carbon capture, climate mitigation finance, geoengineering, climate ethics, and reducing the carbon footprint of Data Science itself.  We will see how the following Data Science and Machine Learning topics can be used to address climate change: regression, gradient boosting, causal inference, interpretability, optimization, image processing, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, time-series analysis, and several neural network architectures.  Using a variety of existing data sources, students will undertake a final project of their choosing to apply a Data Science technique to an aspect of climate change. _Prerequisite: DSAN 5000. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5600: Applied Time Series for Data Science\n\nThe analysis of experimental data collected at different time points presents a fascinating challenge in the realm of statistical modeling and inference. The inherent correlations in Time Series introduced by the sampling of adjacent time points can significantly constrain the applicability of traditional statistical and Machine Learning techniques directly, which often rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed observations. This course offers a systematic exploration of these challenges through the lens of Time Series Analysis, providing students with the tools to unravel the mathematical and statistical complexities associated with temporal dependencies.\n\nThe class ventures into multifaceted aspects of time series analysis, encompassing traditional models such as ARIMA, SARIMA,ARFIMA,  Multivariate TS: VAR, ARIMAX, SARIMAX and VARMAX as well as specialized domains such as Financial Time Series modeling: ARCH, GARCH, GJR-GARCH, E-GARCH, M-GARCH models, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models,Spectral Analysis, and harness the potential of Deep Learning techniques: Fully recurrent(RNN),Long short-term memory (LSTM),Gated recurrent unit (GRU),  Bi-directional, Continuous-time, etc ,Transformers for Time Series data.\n\nIn this course, students will acquire a robust analytical skill set, encompassing model fitting, statistical methods, data visualization, and data storytelling. This course will include structured programming with the R and python languages.\n\nOne of the distinctive features of this course is its emphasis on practical applications. Students will have the opportunity to delve into real-world analysis across diverse domains, including but not limited to, Stock Market Analysis, where students explore intricate financial time series, Econometrics involving the application of time series analysis to economic data for forecasting macroeconomic indicators and market trends, COVID-19 Impact Analysis, Climate Data Analysis, and more. Additionally, students will undertake self-directed time series analysis projects, a mini capstone project, allowing them to apply their acquired skills to areas of personal interest, culminating in the creation of a comprehensive portfolio(a website)—a testament to their proficiency in handling complex temporal data across multifaceted domains.\n\nThis course equips students not only with theoretical knowledge but also practical skills that are invaluable in tackling real-world data challenges across a wide spectrum of applications. It is recommended that students know multivariate calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics at the undergraduate level. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5700: Blockchain Technologies for Data Science\n\nThis course is designed to provide hands-on experience in building public and private blockchains. Students will gain the critical insight, practical knowledge, and technical skills required to design and integrate successful blockchain technologies into a business domain. The course covers the basics of Blockchain technologies including decentralized ledgers, consensus mechanisms, Public and Private key cryptography, smart contracts, etc. The class also examines the public policy and social issues addressed by and arose from adopting blockchain technology in finance, supply chain, and healthcare. The course utilizes Blockchain services (such as Azure) to teach blockchain development on platforms such as Ethereum (or other) and provides the necessary path for learning to build Blockchain networks at scale. Blockchain technologies (distributed ledger, smart contracts, etc.) are a new paradigm in data management and sharing technologies. Gartner Technology hype cycle predicts blockchain to be the industrial ready phase in the next five years. Students will take a deep dive into organizations with integrated blockchain technologies as part of their business strategy. Blockchain’s mainstream use by firms like Walmart, Merck, BlackRock will mean that our Data Analytics program graduates will be interacting with the technology often and will require expertise in handling, extracting, converting data to and from the blockchain. This course will provide an early introduction to the graduates, making them Blockchain-ready. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5800: Advanced Natural Language Processing\n\nThis course provides a formalism for understanding the statistical machine learning methods that have come to dominate natural language processing. Divided into three core modules, the course explores (i) how language understanding is framed as a tractable statistical inference problem, (ii) a formal yet practical treatment of the DNN architectures and learning algorithms used in NLP, and (iii) how these components are leveraged in modern AI systems such as information retrieval, recommender systems, and conversational agents. In exploring these topics, the course exposes students to the foundational math, practical applications, current research directions, and software design that is critical to gaining proficiency as an NLP/ML practitioner. The course culminates in a capstone project, conducted over its final six weeks, in which students apply NLP to an interesting problem of their choosing. In past semesters students have built chatbots, code completion tools, stock trading algorithms, just to name a few. This course assumes a basic understanding of linear algebra, probability theory, first order optimization methods, and proficiency in Python.\n\n_This is an advanced course. Suggested prerequisites are DSAN 5000, DSAN 5100 and DSAN 5400. However, first-year students with the necessary math, statistics, and deep learning background will be considered._ _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5900: Digital Storytelling\n\nTo be successful, a data scientist needs to have many skills beyond coding. This course will teach you how to communicate your findings and data to users, clients, stakeholders to make the biggest impact on your organization and your career. The course consists of two types of activities: lectures and exercises. Lectures provide a theoretical foundation of storytelling; the exercises are designed to help you learn practical skills that work best for different audiences. You will learn what fits your personal style and practice the power of storytelling that can inform and influence decision-makers.\n\nWriting topics will include technical writing, writing for action, and writing for communication in data science with respect to non-technical readers. Storytelling and visualization topics will include methods for presenting results as conclusions, presenting results as actionable items, and creating visual narratives. Interactive visualizations will focus not only on clearly illustrating information within data for use in decision-making, but also for use in discovery and exploration, as well as question generation. Topics in expression, color use, and style will be included _._ You will learn how to make a point with your charts, and how to make your charts clear to the audience. Further topics in the area of information presentation will include speaking with clarity to a team, group, or large audience.\n\nAll parts of the course will contain applications that focus on the utilization of the results of data science and analytics to promote public good, to encourage social concerns and equality, and to support change in areas such as business, public health, and public policy. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 5925: Internship\n\nAn internship provides the student with practical work experience. This course enables international students to do internships at US companies. Students must obtain the approval from the Program Director and submit a Curricular Practical Training (CPT) form to proceed with an internship under this course. To be approved, an internship must be aligned with the Data Science and Analytics program goals and provide a significant learning experience for the student. At the end of the internship, the student must submit a deliverable to the course instructor, _0.25 credits._ (The program does not require students to complete an internship.) _**Offered every semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6150: Biological and Biomedical Data Science\n\nWe are bombarded everyday with multiple claims of health risks (doing this will ruin your health), new treatments and cures (just take this for 30 days for a new you), and better lifestyle choices. How are these claims made, evaluated and validated using data science? Data drives our knowledge of biology, disease and effective treatments. This data is diverse, complex, large, and in many respects unique. This data drives our understanding of whether risk factors or treatments causally change our health outcomes, whether our genes or our environment affects our health, and decisions about drugs, protocols and public health that affect all of us everyday. In this class we explore this rich, diverse data landscape and the specialized methods needed to make sense of it, leveraging the instructor’s decades-long experience in collaborative epidemiological and biomedical research across academia, government and industry. We will explore designing good experiments to extract causal relationships, and how we might still make valid decisions even in non-ideal settings. We will explore high-dimensional multivariate data and evaluate the validity of finding a “needle in a haystack” biomarker that can be targeted for treatment. We will see how statistical modeling (survival analysis in particular), machine learning, AI, and explainable AI have made an impact in helping us understand this world within. We will see how data-driven decision making using Bayesian analysis works. This journey will take us through real-life applications in bioinformatics (understanding how genes, proteins and other molecular markers affect disease), epidemiology (how do diseases spread and how interventions can prevent it) and clinical research (clinical trials, observational studies, case-control studies). DSAN 5100 is a prerequisite. However, first-year DSAN students with the necessary statistics background will be considered. _3 credits_. _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6300: Database Systems and SQL\n\nThis course will explore several aspects of modern database management systems, database programming, relational databases, semi-structured databases, and SQL. The course will begin with an introduction to relational models, normal forms and schema design, relational algebra, and SQL Programming. The course will focus on application development using relational databases and will introduce Big Data concepts and discuss Big Data Processing. Both structured and semi-structured data will be considered, such as XML, JSON, and record-style. Query processing methods will be applied and evaluated. Topics will also include recursion in SQL, constraints and triggers, indices and transactions, data storage including column-oriented and distributed storage, noSQL, and different types of databases, such as non-relational, scientific, parallel, and streaming. The course will discuss types of database-system architectures, including cloud-based services. Applications will coincide with data science and analytics, as well as public policy, intelligence generation, and narratives. Tools may also include cloud-based DBMS. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6400: Network Analytics\n\nThe design and analysis of networks to represent interactions between and within data is a quickly emerging discipline of significant importance. Data Analytics combines graph theory, optimization, data science, data visualization, community and cluster analysis, and more. Topics in this course will help answer intriguing questions such as, “How can we make sense of large, highly-associated data sets, ranging from social networks to the smart power grid?” or “Which models are more accurate for predicting popularity on Twitter?” or “How can we estimate the spread of a contagion or of information?” The course will begin with a discussion of applications, specifically to data science and analytics. From there, a formal framework for analysis of graphs and trees will be introduced. This will include graph theory and representation, optimization, and graph-based algorithms. Next packages in Python and/or R will be investigated for the purposes of exploring and visualizing data that contain relationships. These packages will then be used to model and analyze complex data sets for the purposes of community detection, path analysis, influencer assessment, logistics analytics, contagion or information spread (such as rumor spreading), web page ranking, and more. Examples of data science applications are provided with real-world data sets including social network data, web-based data, attributed data, flow data, biological data, and more. _3 credits_. _**Offered in the Summer semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6500: Computer Vision & Generative Image Modeling\n\nComputer Vision Analytics & Generative Image Modeling offers a comprehensive introduction to image mining and computer vision.

Additionally, the curriculum delves into advanced optimization, neuro-symbolic AI, and bio-inspired deep learning. Various practical applications are covered to equip students with the skills to address complex deep learning challenges across diverse domains.  _Prerequisite: DSAN 5100. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall and Spring semesters.**_\n\n### DSAN 6650: Reinforcement Learning\n\nThe field of machine learning is typically divided into three fundamental sub-paradigms. These include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning (RL). The discipline of reinforcement learning focuses on how intelligent agents learn to perform actions, inside a specified environment, to maximize a cumulative reward function. Over the past several decades, there has been a push to incorporate concepts from the field of deep-learning into the agents used in RL algorithms. This has spawned the field of deep reinforcement learning. To date, the field of deep RL has yielded stunning results in a wide range of technological applications. These include, but are not limited to, self-driving cars, autonomous game play, robotics, trading and finance, and Natural Language Processing. This course will begin with an introduction to the fundamentals of traditional, i.e. non-deep, reinforcement learning. After reviewing fundamental deep learning topics the course will transition to deep RL by incorporating artificial neural networks into the models. The course includes a coding emphasis to showcase applied implementations of RL within the python ecosystem. Topics include multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, function approximation via neural networks, Markov decision processes, Monte Carlo methods, temporal difference learning, deep Q-learning, actor-critic methods, and policy gradient methods. Students must have intermediate coding experience in Python as well as knowledge of introductory statistics and multivariable calculus. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6700: Machine Learning App Deployment\n\nThis course will focus on gathering data so as to build an ensemble of machine learning methods that can predict, classify, and explore data entered by a client. This is an applied class that will engage in the steps required to create and deploy online a ML application that can be utilized by a client. Topics will include a very brief review of common ML techniques including NB, SVM, DT, RF, ARM, NN, and clustering. APIs will be used to gather, explore, clean, and prepare data for training a ML model ensemble. The model will be deployed via a client-server web application to enable clients to enter data and receive a classification or prediction. _Prerequisite: DSAN 5000. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6725: Applied Generative AI for AI Developers\n\nThis course is designed for AI developers aiming to build cutting-edge Generative AI (GenAI) applications. Focusing on the applied side of AI, students will explore key techniques such as in-context learning (ICL), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), AI agents, and responsible AI principles. The course covers advanced tools and methods, including embedding models, inference optimizations (e.g., quantization, multi-adapter swapping), fine-tuning of pre-trained models and benchmarking LLMs. Students will gain hands-on experience with open-source tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and platforms such as AWS, applying their skills in practical GenAI applications. The course culminates in a capstone project, preparing participants to deploy scalable, optimized AI systems in real-world scenarios. This course bridges the gap between data science knowledge and applied AI development, empowering students to solve industry-level challenges. _This is an advanced course open to second-year students. However, first-year students may register with permission from the instructor. 3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6750: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Applications\n\nGeographic Information Systems (GIS) are used as tools for describing, analyzing, managing, and presenting information about the relationships between geographical and spatial locations, sizes, and shapes. This is known as attribute data. GIS uses techniques that can represent social and environmental data as a map, with a significant number of applications including those in engineering, architecture, public health, environmental science, and business. GIS data will be created through a variety of methods including those offered by global positioning system (GPS) technologies. This course will assume knowledge of R and Python. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 6850: NLP with Large Language Models\n\nIn recent times, Large Language Models (LLMs) have earned the attention of the world. OpenAI’s infamous generative LLM, ChatGPT, became the fastest-growing consumer application in history in only two months–and the feverish interest around LLMs continues to grow. This course is concerned with applying LLMs to natural language processing (NLP) problems in real-life settings. This is a seminar-based course, so students will spend the majority of time outside of class reading, with in-class time dedicated to presenting and discussing recent research developments in NLP. The course will begin with a review of the transformer architecture that underlies LLMs and describe its prominent role in modern NLP. Then, we will discuss modern issues using transformers, including: the training and scaling of transformer-based models, variations on the classic transformer, transfer learning in low-resource settings, model deployment, distributed systems, and more. Meta-learning, multimodal learning, and societal impact will also be covered. Students will work on applications such as cross-language information retrieval, machine translation, prompt engineering, and select tasks outside of NLP. By the end of the course, students will have mastered transformer-based models and will be poised to use them at the cutting edge of NLP practice today. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n### DSAN 7000: Advanced Research Methodologies (Capstone Project)\n\nThe aim of this course is to teach students advanced research methodologies in developing data science research projects as well as effective scientific writing. Topics will include the principles of research questions development, research methods selection, effective results interpretation, effective writing, appropriate journal paper writing styles, peer review, authorship, and communicating scientific ideas to academic and non-academic audiences. In addition, this course will provide guidance on paper publishing, including how to identify an appropriate journal, navigating the selection process, editing, and measuring impact. Ideal outcomes include improved self-editing, development of effective strategies for offering and receiving concise editorial recommendations among peers, and finalizing a research paper to be submitted to academic publications (e.g., journal, conference, research reports, etc.). This course specifically targets students who are interested in learning academic research practices and/or pursuing further education opportunities in a PhD program. The ideal outcome is to make a submission for academic publication, and students are encouraged to submit high-quality papers to academic journals. Although publication cannot be guaranteed, students will experience the learning process of submitting a research paper. _Prerequisites: DSAN 5000, DSAN 5100, DSAN 5300; Knowledge about data science, introductory statistics, statistical learning, and coding experience in R and/or Python._ _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Fall semester.**_\n\n[Back to Top](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/academics/data-science-course-descriptions/elective-courses-data-science/#TOP)",

Therefore, these two DSAN graduate classes will count toward both the students’ BS (BA) and toward the MS.\n- This option **saves both time and money**, allows students to graduate with a Bachelor’s degree AND a Master of Science degree in Data Science and Analytics in 5 years (accelerated), and will advance academic and industry potential.\n- **Prerequisites**: Calc I, II, Probability & Statistics (or equivalent such as econometrics, etc.), programming R, Python, or C++ (Python is recommended). Interested students should assure completion of these classes during their undergraduate degree. There are many options for these prerequisites. For example, statistics, math stats, prob & stats, econometrics, etc. are all considered “statistics” and will meet the requirement.\n\n- **Students should apply to the _Accelerated DSAN Program_ in their junior year.** [Click here for more details on when and how to apply.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ptlfcvFxBsShcwhmbdum5tQ9F0Kw3ctFiJ1RglsJFQU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Steps for Students:**\n\n- Learn about the new program by contacting gradanalytics@georgetown.edu.\n- Plan to apply in your junior year.\n- Plan to complete the prerequisites: Calc I, II, Probability & Statistics (or equivalent), Programming/CS as noted above. There are many options for these types of classes.\n- Apply to the BS(A) – MS DSAN Program\n- After acceptance, students will then take any two (2) of the following DSAN graduate class options during their senior year from this list (DSAN 5000, 5100, 5200, 5300). Students will also engage, after their junior year, in our free and online R and Python Programming Bootcamp.\n  - Generally, the minimum required GPA for applicants is 3.5, but we consider many criteria.\n  - **We DO NOT require the GRE.**\n- Students cannot register for any DSAN classes until they apply and are accepted into the Accelerated DSAN Program.\n- Students may start the BS(A) – MS Program in Fall or Spring.\n- Once students are accepted, complete the above, and graduate with their BS(A), they will then officially become MS students in DSAN and will complete the remaining 8 required DSAN classes.\n- Timing: Students may complete the remaining DSAN requirements in 3 terms. If summer is included (per the student’s choice) they can complete the MS in one year.\n\nDetails about DSAN 5000, 5100, 5200, and 5300 can be found [here](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/program-overview/course-descriptions/#core-courses).\n\n[Check Out the Accelerated Program Info Session Slides](https://georgetown.box.com/s/ksssr0g34oh9usmj110bg2de8a6wou1w)\n\n## **Further Details**\n\n**Prerequisites:** Undergraduate students who elect to apply to the Accelerated DSAN Program and who are accepted will complete the prerequisites during their undergraduate degree.\n\n1. In some cases, such as Math, Statistics, CS, and Economics, such prerequisites are likely part of the standard program. However, for other programs, such as Biology, students will need to specifically take these required requisite classes.\n   - There are often many options for classes. For example, Prob & Stats, Statistics, Math Stats, Econometrics, etc. are all considered “statistics.”\n2. **Counting Courses Twice – for BS(A) and for MS:** In the Accelerated Program, students are permitted to take DSAN classes that will **count twice – once toward their BS(A) and again toward the MS in DSAN.**\n   - Normally, students can take these DSAN graduate classes as general electives.\n   - However, ask your undergraduate advising dean if you have the option to take these classes as **major electives (electives toward the major) and not just general electives.** This will offer greater opportunities and flexibility.\n\n     - Math students can take DSAN 5100 instead of MATH 2140; i.e. they can count DSAN 5100 as their math elective instead of MATH 2140, but they cannot get Math credit for both courses.\n   - Once students complete their BS (or BA), **they will then officially become graduate students in the MS DSAN Program and will complete all remaining 8 courses for the MS degree.**\n   - **You CAN complete the MS in 1 year (12 months) and you can choose to start in Fall or Spring.**\n   - **You will participate in the required, free, self-directed and fully online “Programming in R and Python Bootcamp” as all MS students do. This is generally done the summer before you take DSAN 5000.**\n3. Generally, the minimum required GPA for applicants is 3.5, but we consider many criteria.\n4. **We DO NOT require the GRE.**",

Their work focuses on interdisciplinary data science and public policy research across the university. The Data Science and Analytics Program (DSAN) has supported a total of 25 of [our students](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/our-mdi-scholars/) since we began partnering with MDI in 2022. Many of these students found themselves winning a spot as an MDI scholar for multiple semesters.\n\n## Capstone Elective\n\nWe are excited to have a Capstone Elective as part of our 2023-2024 Academic Curriculum. This course focuses on conducting research in collaboration with renowned institutes and academic leaders. It provides students with an opportunity to work on cutting-edge research projects that have the potential to make a real impact in the field of data science.\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/11/Classroom-Photo-2048x1463.jpg)\n\nFirst-year students in our intro class: DSAN 5000-Data Science and Analytics\n\nThe 2023-2024 Capstone Projects will be conducted in collaboration with organizations such as AstraZeneca, the FDA, Lima Labs, the DC Department of Insurance, and the Hildreth Institute.\n\nExposure to such collaborations with industry experts provides a unique perspective\n\nto our students’ research experience. Thesis based research provides students the ability to enhance their analytical skills and provides experience with the process of conducting research and writing for publications, especially for students who want to pursue a PhD or a higher degree.\n\n## Real World Datasets\n\n![Cynthia stands to the left of her poster, in front of a wood-paneled wall.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/11/Cynthia-Poster-Data-Science-Conf.png)\n\nCynthia Ng presents a poster at the DSAN Data Science Conference, September 8, 2023\n\nOur courses are diligently developed to ensure that students learn to work with real-world data and within typical industry time constraints. We also ensure that students have the opportunity to not only take our Digital Storytelling elective but also learn how to synthesize and tell stories through their final projects.\n\n> _Real-world datasets are normally less clean and have non-uniform distributions which makes it harder to analyze and clean. It is important to face the issues that arise with those types of datasets during class. Especially in preparation for future career tasks._\n>\n> **Valeria Vera Lagos, MS ’24**",

Applicants should allow six to eight weeks from the test date for the reporting of scores. If you are a non-native speaker of English and received a bachelor’s or advanced degree from an accredited institution of higher education where English is the primary language of instruction, you do not have to submit TOEFL or IELTS scores.\n- Georgetown University’s institution code for reporting TOEFL scores is 5244.\n\n## Agenda from Admission to Enrollment\n\n- Gather [required documentation](https://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/students/new-students/required-documents/) for Georgetown Form I-20 or Form DS-2019 Issuance.\n- After receiving the Georgetown Form I-20 or Form DS-2019 students are ready to [apply for the F-1 or J-1 visa,](https://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/students/new-students/visa/)\n- Finalize [travel arrangements](https://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/students/new-students/visa/#c_cb63bb7f91f4).\n- [Plan arrival at Georgetown.](https://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/students/new-students/visa/#c_adf58047b573)\n- Attend the [International Graduate Student Orientation](https://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/students/new-students/orientation/#_ga=2.174764706.1239715907.1697138151-1641138770.1682710473)\n\n## International Student Resources\n\nThe Georgetown Office of Global Services has a [detailed resource guide](https://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/students/new-students/#_ga=2.153280184.1239715907.1697138151-1641138770.1682710473) to help you navigate your journey to Georgetown.\n\n**\\*** The CIP code for this program is 30.3001 – **this program is STEM-eligible**.",

    "markdown": "# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n## Applications\n\n**Do you require the GRE?**\n\nNo.\n\n**Can I waive the TOEFL?**\n\nIf you earn your degree from an accredited institution in which English is the primary language of instruction, you do not have to submit TOEFL/IELTS scores.\n\n**Will you consider TOEFL MyBest score?**\n\nNo, we do not accept the TOEFL MyBest Score.\n\n**Can I update my TOEFL/IELTS score after submitting my application?**\n\nYou can resubmit your TOEFL/IELTS scores, but if you do so after December 15th, it can affect your status as a priority applicant. If you are aiming for the January 15th deadline, you can update your scores before the final deadline.\n\n**How do I edit a recommender’s personal information or change my recommender?**\n\n[Log in to the application portal](https://gradapply.georgetown.edu/account/login?r=https%3a%2f%2fgradapply.georgetown.edu%2fapply%2f), and then navigate to your application status page and click the link below the checklist to get to the recommendations page. Select the recommender you would like to edit or update. To change the email address of a recommender, click on their name on the recommendations page then click “exclude.” Then re-add the recommender using the updated email address.\n\n**My recommender is unable to receive the link or submit their letter – what should I do?**\n\nPlease have your recommender double check their spam folder for the link. If all else fails, they may email their letter to the Office of Graduate Admissions at [gradmail@georgetown.edu](mailto:gradmail@georgetown.edu).\n\n**How should I submit my WES evaluation?**\n\nYou will not need to send your WES report to our school at this time; instead, you should ask WES to send the evaluation directly to you, and then you should upload the evaluation directly to the online application. An official transcript will be required if you are offered admission to the program.\n\n**How can I check to see if all of my application materials have been received?**\n\nYou can check the status of application materials, including test scores, transcripts, letters of recommendation, etc. by navigating back to our [online application](https://gradapply.georgetown.edu/account/login?r=https%3a%2f%2fgradapply.georgetown.edu%2fapply%2f) and viewing your application status page. Please note it can take up to 24 hours for the system to process materials and reflect this on your status page.\n\n**When are the application deadlines?**\n\nOur **Fall Priority deadline is December 15th**. All supporting materials will also need to be submitted by this date for priority consideration. Our **Fall Final deadline is January 15th**. All supporting materials must also be submitted by this date for consideration.\n\nFor our **Accelerated BS/MS program** (for Georgetown students only) has **both a fall and spring admission date**. The final **Fall Semester deadline is February 15th** and all supporting documentation must be received by this date for consideration for Fall admission. The final **Spring Semester deadline is October 1st** and all supporting documentation must be received by this date for consideration for Spring admission.\n\n**When can I expect to receive my admission decision?**\n\nIf you apply and your application is complete (all materials received) by our priority deadline of **December 15**, you can expect to receive a decision by **March 1 or earlier**. If you apply and your application is complete by our final deadline of **January 15**, you can expect to receive a decision by **April 1 or earlier**. If all of your application materials are received after our final deadline, your application will be reviewed and you will receive a decision, but we cannot guarantee that you will receive your decision by a particular date.\n\n**Can I apply to your program and another GU program?**\n\nGeorgetown does allow prospective students to apply to multiple graduate programs, but you must submit two separate applications and pay two separate application fees.\n\n**I have two majors, how should I fill out the application history part of the application?**\n\nOur admissions committee will carefully read your transcript and resume, and they will see that you have two majors. However, in the interest of completing the online application, it is suggested that you choose your main focus or the subject area that is most relevant to our program.\n\n**Can I get an application fee waiver?**\n\nUnfortunately, we do not offer application fee waivers. If you would like to learn more about the financial support you can receive at Georgetown, please check [here.](https://grad.georgetown.edu/financial-support/)\n\n**Can I be admitted for Spring semester?**\n\nOur program does not offer Spring admission.\n\n**How do I contact the Office of Graduate Admissions?**\n\nPhone: 202-687-5568\n\nFax: 202-687-6802\n\nE-mail: [gradmail@georgetown.edu](mailto:gradmail@georgetown.edu)\n\n## Preparing for Your Degree\n\n**How much mathematics coursework should I have to be successful in this program?**\n\nStudents who apply should have taken Calculus I & II at the college level. It is also essential to have taken a full course in multivariable (vector) calculus and done well in it (B or better). Linear algebra is highly desirable but not required. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to contact the program.\n\n**How much experience with statistics should I have to be successful in this program?**\n\nApplicants should have taken a calculus-based statistics course that covers elementary probability, properties of random variables, common discrete and continuous distributions, expectations, the central limit theorem, parameter estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and possibly elements of linear regression. It is desirable if you have used a computational statistics package in this class, for example SPSS, R, or Stata. If you have taken the first course of a statistics sequence for economics majors (the second course would then be econometrics), you may also be adequately prepared. If you have questions, please [contact the program](mailto:gradanalytics@georgetown.edu?subject=I%20have%20a%20question%20about%20my%20statistics%20preparation).\n\n**How much computer science experience should I have to be successful in this program?**\n\nR and Python are used extensively throughout the program. R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, and Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Students should have working experience or have taken coursework on these languages prior to admission. In addition, introductory computer science coursework focusing on C++ and/or Java will help familiarize students with general programming.\n\n**I haven’t taken a programming course in college, but I became proficient with programming languages while working for my current employer and am now spending most of my time coding in that language. How should I document my computer science proficiency?**\n\nAlthough we prefer live (classroom-based) courses, you can take an online certificate program in R or Python and upload the certificate with your application to demonstrate proficiency. You can also ask a supervisor to submit a letter of recommendation in which your coding work could be addressed.\n\n**I expect to have some time available before I enter the program this Fall. How can I better prepare during the summer?**\n\nThe Georgetown Data Science & Analytics program gives an online course in programming preparation that covers R, Python, and command line use in the summer prior to matriculation. The course is equivalent to three credits, is designed for matriculating MS Data Science & Analytics students, and is offered free of charge. It is required for all incoming students. This course runs during the Georgetown Summer Session. Students must complete this course to matriculate in the fall. It is not an intro course, and assumes at least a basic level of proficiency in R and Python. If you do not have a basic knowledge of both languages, we highly recommend taking some online courses before taking our summer online course.\n\n**I have only taken Calculus I and Calculus II. Can I get admitted to this program?**\n\nYou can take our required courses at a local college before applying. Many community colleges offer these courses at convenient times. If you are unable to take a classroom-based course, the next best thing is to take a certificate course online. We’re happy to work with you to prepare a plan. You should also refresh your calculus knowledge before enrolling in our required courses.\n\n**I don’t have any programming experience. Can I get admitted to this program?**\n\nYou can acquire this experience in a number of ways, including college courses, online certificates, and and company training. We expect applicants to have a basic knowledge of both R and Python. A good place to start is our list of suggested [resources for completing the prerequisites](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/how-to-apply/#resources-for-completing-prerequisites).\n\n**I am currently taking prerequisite coursework to fulfill program admission requirements. Can I apply for admission before I have completed the course(s) and be admitted to this program?**\n\nAlthough you are permitted to apply without the prerequisites, you should be aware that you will be competing against applicants who have already completed the prerequisite courses and can provide final grades for them. If you are taking prerequisite coursework when you apply, please indicate on your application that these courses are “in-progress.” When you have completed the courses, please be sure to upload a new transcript reflecting the course grades.\n\n**I have not taken one or more prerequisite courses. Can I take these classes over the summer before Fall classes begin?**\n\nAlthough you are permitted to apply without the prerequisites, you should be aware that you will be competing against applicants who have already completed the prerequisite courses and can provide final grades for them. So while you have a chance of being admitted if the rest of your application is strong, your application will not be as competitive as those who have already completed the required courses. You would have a much better chance of being admitted if you complete all prerequisites before applying. A good place to start is our suggested list of [resources for completing the prerequisites](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/how-to-apply/#resources-for-completing-prerequisites).\n\n**I took Econometrics in college, and we did a good deal of statistics in that course. Am I prepared adequately?**\n\nThis preparation is usually sufficient. To make sure, please send us more detail about your preparation, including perhaps a syllabus or information about the textbook that was used.\n\n**Is there a minimum GPA for applicants?**\n\nThe Graduate School expects a B-average (3.0 or better) for applicants. We want to make sure that entering students can meet or come close to this requirement. For a successful application, evidence of success in advanced mathematics, statistics and/or computer science courses is even more important. If the application shows this, a student with a slightly lower GPA may still have a chance of admission.\n\n## Financial Questions\n\n**What kind of financial assistance is available for students?**\n\nThe Data Science & Analytics program offers merit-based scholarships to both incoming and continuing students. There are also opportunities for student employment as a research assistant or teaching assistant. You can learn about how assistantships work by visiting the [Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Financial Support](http://grad.georgetown.edu/financial-support) page. As a returning student in your second year, you will be eligible to compete for a [merit-based scholarship](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/returning-scholarships/).\n\n**What other possibilities are there for student employment?**\n\nThere are Research Assistant (RA) and Teaching Assistant (TA) opportunities on campus. Assistantships are generally awarded to continuing students who have performed well academically. These positions are usually found through word-of-mouth or via [Georgetown’s Student Employment Office](https://seo.georgetown.edu/JobX_FindAJob.aspx?t=qs&qs=21); you need a NetID to log in, which can be found in your offer letter.\n\n**Will I receive an automatic offer of financial assistance when I get admitted?**\n\nOur scholarships are merit-based and are not determined based on financial need. _**All applicants**_ are considered for merit-based scholarships.\n\n**If I don’t receive an offer for a scholarship upon admission, will I have another chance once I am enrolled?**\n\nAs a returning student in your second year, you will be eligible to compete for a [merit-based scholarship](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/returning-scholarships/).\n\n## Course Planning\n\n**How many courses can I take at a time?**\n\nThree courses per semester is the normal load for full time students. Part-time students who also have a full-time job may take either one or two courses per semester. Working full time and taking three graduate courses is not recommended.\n\n**Can I be a part-time student?**\n\nYes. This is possible for students who are not on a student visa. This may be a good option for students who wish to continue their full-time job while attending the program, especially if they receive financial support from their employer. Graduate School rules state that students admitted to a master’s degree program are allowed three years from matriculation to complete all requirements for the degree.\n\n**Is it possible to switch between part-time and full-time status?**\n\nYes. It is possible to switch back and forth between full-time and part-time status, and many students do this depending on their desired balance of work and study. However, international students must remain on full-time status throughout and may only switch to part-time status during their last semester. In addition, students should keep in mind that they are required to complete the program within three calendar years.\n\n**Do graduate students have academic advisors?**\n\nYes. Individual advising is available to all graduate students.\n\n**Does the program offer graduate courses during the summer?**\n\nYes, the Data Science & Analytics program typically offers one to two classes during summer semester. Students may also take coursework from other programs to satisfy elective requirements during the summer.\n\n**When and where will classes be offered?**\n\nAll classes will be offered on Georgetown University’s Main Campus. View directions to the [Main Campus](https://www.georgetown.edu/plan-your-visit/#visiting-main-campus) and [campus maps](http://maps.georgetown.edu/). Classes in this program usually meet one day per week, often in the late afternoon (3:30 – 6:00pm) or evening (6:30 – 9:00pm), although we also offer morning classes.\n\n**How easy is it to take courses in other programs or departments?**\n\nThe Data Science and Analytics program offers a large number of elective classes tailored specifically toward our students, so we highly recommend that you select electives within our program! However, if you have a specialized interest, you can talk to us about taking an elective class in another department if it is relevant to your degree.\n\n**Is it possible to take courses out of sequence?**\n\nWe strongly recommend against it. The curriculum has been carefully designed to maximize your experience and your performance.\n\n**How often are the core and elective courses offered?**\n\nThe required core courses and the elective courses are offered every year. DSAN-5000: Introduction to Data Analytics is always offered in the Fall.\n\n**What is the typical number of students in a graduate class?**\n\nThe class size will typically be capped at 25-35, but classes will also run with smaller sizes.\n\n**Will I be able to get a seat in the course I want to take?**\n\nYou will always be able to get a seat in core Data Science & Analytics courses. Popular electives in the Data Science & Analytics program sometimes fill to capacity, but this is rare.\n\n**Can I take elective courses before completing the core courses?**\n\nYes. This is possible, and you are encouraged to do so. Be sure to check the prerequisites of any course that you wish to take.\n\n**I have taken graduate courses elsewhere. What are the rules for transferring credit?**\n\nThe Graduate School allows students to transfer up to 25% of the curriculum for qualifying graduate courses from other institutions, as long as these courses have not been used to satisfy requirements for a previous degree and the grade is at least a B. In practice this means that two courses (6 credits) could be transferred. Transferred courses may not substitute for required core courses, and core courses may not be waived.\n\nAfter satisfactory completion of at least one semester of full-time registration in the Graduate School, a DSAN student may make a written request for the transfer of credit for specific applicable courses taken (a) at another accredited institution or (b) at Georgetown University prior to admission to DSAN. Requests for transfer of credit must be made in writing through the DSAN Director of Graduate Studies, with a syllabus and transcript attached.\n\n## Internships\n\n**Is there an internship requirement for the degree?**\n\nThere is no internship requirement, but many students seek internship opportunities during the summer.\n\n**Am I guaranteed an internship?**\n\nOur program strives to provide our students with networking opportunities that will assist them in building relationships with companies through career fairs, panel discussions, and seminars. We also regularly share internship opportunities with our students that have been shared with us by many top companies in tech, finance, federal government, etc. However, it is up to each student to apply for internships on their own. In addition, the [Graduate Career Center](https://gradcareer.georgetown.edu/) is a good resource available to all Georgetown graduate students.\n\n**How does an internship actually work?**\n\nAn internship takes place off campus, at a location and in an environment that is not connected to Georgetown University. It could even occur outside of the Washington, DC area. Summer internships are usually full-time and normally last about eight weeks. They may continue into the academic year on a part-time basis. Internships during the academic year are usually part-time. Internships do not carry academic credit.\n\n**Can I get paid for an internship?**\n\nInterns are usually paid for their work. However, there is no guarantee. Keep in mind that the financial benefit of an internship may come later, when you apply for a job and can reference your past experience.\n\n## International Students\n\n_All answers are to the best of current knowledge. They are subject to change and do not constitute legal advice or commitments. Please review our [International Student Resources](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/students/international/) page for detailed information for incoming and current international students._\n\n**Where can I get advice about visa, work restrictions, etc.?**\n\nYour main point of contact is the [International Student and Scholar Services](http://internationalservices.georgetown.edu/) group in the [Office of Global Services](http://globalservices.georgetown.edu/). You will be able to meet with an advisor from that office when you first arrive on campus.\n\n**Is this program of study STEM-eligible?**\n\nYes. International graduates of this program have the opportunity to extend their Optional Practical Training (OPT) from 12 to 24 months, assuming all other requirements are met. The CIP number of this program is 30.3001 (Computational Science).\n\n**Can I take an internship during the summer?**\n\nYes, this is possible. We offer a 0.25 credit course titled _DSAN 5925 -Internship_ that can be taken during the summer which will allow you to apply for CPT. Another option would be to utilize OPT during your internship.\n\n**I plan to go home to visit my family during the summer and will not be able to take a summer course. Will this be a problem?**\n\nNo. The only required summer course will be taken asynchronously online, prior to starting the program in the Fall. Other summer courses will always be electives, and will not be required for graduation.\n\n**Can I become a grader or course assistant?**\n\nYes. International students are eligible for on-campus employment within certain limits.\n\n**Are international students eligible for financial aid?**\n\nYes. International students are always considered for scholarship offers.\n\n## General Questions\n\nYou may wish to review the [Graduate Admissions F.A.Q. page](https://grad.georgetown.edu/admissions/admissions-faq/), which contains useful information about graduate admissions and programs for prospective students.\n\n**Does Georgetown University provide housing for graduate students?**\n\nWhile there is no on-campus housing for graduate students, there is new Georgetown graduate student housing at [55H Street.](https://residentialliving.georgetown.edu/55-h-st-graduate-housing/) The [Office of Neighborhood Life](https://neighborhood.georgetown.edu/georgetown-students/finding-rental/graduate-students/) is a great resource to learn more about off-campus options. There’s also a wealth of housing and student life information on the [Graduate School of Arts & Science’s website](http://grad.georgetown.edu/student-life/life-wash-DC).\n\n**Is there a Georgetown University bus system that students can use?**\n\nYes. It is called [Georgetown University Transportation Shuttle (GUTS)](http://otm.georgetown.edu/guts/) and is free for students and University employees. It serves Dupont Circle, Arlington, Rosslyn, and several other locations.\n\n**Is it possible to have a part-time job while being a full-time student?**\n\nYes. This is something that many graduate students in related fields do, for example after a successful summer internship. International students are eligible for on-campus employment, but their employment opportunities off campus are restricted.\n\n**Is it possible to have a full-time job while being a full-time student?**\n\nStudents are strongly discouraged from doing this. You are putting both your job performance and your academic performance at risk when you attempt this.\n\n**Is there a thesis requirement for the degree?**\n\nNo. There is no thesis requirement.\n\n**Can I write a thesis instead of completing courses?**\n\nThere is currently no thesis option for the degree. However, students may find instructors and work with them on research projects. Such research may then lead to publishable papers.\n\n[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-BSC82Y20RS&gacid=1721799436.1743169515&gtm=45je53q1v9104488821z877583222za200zb77583222&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=102015666~102482433~102788824~102803279~102813109~102887799~102926062~102975948&z=1561803244)[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/ga/rul?tid=G-PMZB7WHYPX&gacid=1721799436.1743169515&gtm=45je53q1v9104793239z877583222za200zb77583222&dma=0&gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1&npa=0&pscdl=noapi&aip=1&fledge=1&frm=0&tag_exp=102482433~102509682~102788824~102803279~102813109~102887799~102926062~102964103&z=454372180)[iframe](https://14950278.fls.doubleclick.net/activityi;src=14950278;type=anlytcal;cat=anlytcal;ord=7306327210274;npa=0;auiddc=881264364.1743169514;ps=1;pcor=1603940080;uaa=x86;uab=64;uafvl=Chromium%3B134.0.6998.165%7CNot%253AA-Brand%3B24.0.0.0%7CGoogle%2520Chrome%3B134.0.6998.165;uamb=0;uam=;uap=Linux%20x86_64;uapv=6.6.72;uaw=0;pscdl=noapi;frm=0;_tu=KlA;gtm=45fe53q1v9198042436z877583222za201zb9104793239;gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1;dma=0;dc_fmt=1;tag_exp=102482433~102509682~102788824~102803279~102813109~102887799~102926062~102964102;epver=2;~oref=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.georgetown.edu%2Ffrequently-asked-questions%2F?)[iframe](https://td.doubleclick.net/td/fls/rul/activityi;fledge=1;src=14950278;type=anlytcal;cat=anlytcal;ord=7306327210274;npa=0;auiddc=881264364.1743169514;ps=1;pcor=1603940080;uaa=x86;uab=64;uafvl=Chromium%3B134.0.6998.165%7CNot%253AA-Brand%3B24.0.0.0%7CGoogle%2520Chrome%3B134.0.6998.165;uamb=0;uam=;uap=Linux%20x86_64;uapv=6.6.72;uaw=0;pscdl=noapi;frm=0;_tu=KlA;gtm=45fe53q1v9198042436z877583222za201zb9104793239;gcd=13l3l3l3l1l1;dma=0;dc_fmt=9;tag_exp=102482433~102509682~102788824~102803279~102813109~102887799~102926062~102964102;epver=2;~oref=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.georgetown.edu%2Ffrequently-asked-questions%2F?)\n\n![](https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=13014621&tm=gtm002&Ver=2&mid=d2e7e9ab-018e-4e10-a0b4-4c80bb6e0309&bo=1&sid=e0bd9a800bda11f099f2af710be73c1a&vid=e0bd98500bda11f0b230afa20aec6f96&vids=1&msclkid=N&pi=918639831&lg=en-US&sw=1280&sh=1024&sc=24&tl=FAQs%20-%20Master%20in%20Data%20Science%20%26%20Analytics%20-%20Georgetown%20University&p=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.georgetown.edu%2Ffrequently-asked-questions%2F&r=&lt=693&evt=pageLoad&sv=1&cdb=AQAQ&rn=303855)\n\n[iframe](about:blank)[iframe](https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/up?adv=tz1xvy0&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.georgetown.edu%2Ffrequently-asked-questions%2F&upid=a8id7gz&upv=1.1.0&paapi=1)",

    "markdown": "# Our Community\n\nWe are dedicated to creating a community within the DSAN program and feel that an active and supportive community fosters both academic and social success. Graduate programs can be overwhelming and even isolating at times. It is part of our mission to ensure that our students have a safe and supportive environment in which to thrive.\n\n#### Looking for a supportive community that will walk through your graduate school journey with you? Look no further! Our program fosters a sense of belonging with several initiatives and opportunities for connection, from our Mentorship Program to our regular DSAN social events. Check out some of the ways that we support community building among our DSAN cohorts, staff, faculty, and alumni.\n\n## DSAN Social Committee\n\nThe DSAN Social Committee was formed with the belief that student leadership is integral to ensuring that our program’s events are targeted to the evolving needs of our student body. The committee consists of students from both our first and second-year cohorts.\n\nNow in its second year, the Social Committee has become a force for connection within our community. They assist with planning and support for many of our program-sponsored events, while also creating smaller ad hoc opportunities for socializing, e.g. trivia night, hiking trips, etc.\n\n[Skip the following collection of 3 photos and continue to the content immediately following.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/our-community/#carousel-skipped)\n\nSlide 1 _of_ 3\n\nSlide1 _of_ 3\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/5-1024x768.png)\n\nSlide2 _of_ 3\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/1-1-1024x768.png)\n\nSlide3 _of_ 3\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/4-1024x768.png)\n\nEnd of carousel collection.\n\n## Student Mentorship Program\n\nOur built-in student support system provides incoming students with guidance and advice as they move through their first year in our program. Incoming students are matched with a second-year student mentor based on their undergraduate major, common goals, and shared interests.\n\nMentors act as a consistently available resource for incoming students, and may provide guidance on topics such as where to live; what to expect from classes; how and when to start looking for an internship; and any other questions first-year students might have. Mentors and mentees meet for lunch, dinner, coffee, and various activities in Washington, D.C. Mentors are available throughout the year whenever their mentees need guidance.\n\n[Skip the following collection of 4 photos and continue to the content immediately following.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/our-community/#carousel-skipped)\n\nSlide 1 _of_ 4\n\nSlide1 _of_ 4\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/hiking3-1024x768.jpg)\n\nSlide2 _of_ 4\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/1-3-1024x1024.png)\n\nSlide3 _of_ 4\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/3-2-1024x768.png)\n\nSlide4 _of_ 4\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/10/2-2-1024x768.png)\n\nEnd of carousel collection.\n\n## The DSAN Suite\n\nAs our program has grown, our suite has become a study haven for many of our students.

Dr. Purna Gamage, Dr. James Hickman, Dr. Jeff Jacobs, and Dr. Abhijit Dasgupta took time out of their busy schedules to share invaluable insights on applications and job searching.\n\nThe day kicked off with a resume-building session led by Dr. Gamage and Dr. Hickman. Dr. Gamage introduced tools like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and how to tailor resumes for specific job descriptions, while Dr. Hickman covered the essentials of resumes and cover letters, sharing personal tips for highlighting key traits of high performers.\n\nNext, we broke into groups for technical and behavioral interview practice. Dr. Hickman and Dr. Dasgupta led technical sessions, providing real-world coding and conceptual problems for us to solve independently before discussing as a group. Their guidance on tackling technical challenges under pressure was incredibly helpful.\n\nOn the behavioral side, Dr. Gamage, Dr. Jacobs, and Dr. Dasgupta conducted mock interviews, offering feedback on how to respond to tough questions. Switching between technical and behavioral practice midway through the session allowed everyone to experience both aspects of the interview process. Each professor’s insight was nothing short of impressive.\n\nThe day wrapped up with an elevator pitch workshop led by Dr. Dasgupta. He gave helpful advice, emphasized the importance of a memorable pitch, and gave us time to craft and practice our own in small groups. Many students, along with myself, left feeling more confident in their ability to pitch themselves effectively.\n\nI could list all the resources and tips I gained from the event, but there are too many, and honestly, you’d benefit more from attending the next one yourself! DSAN offers so many opportunities to help us succeed—make sure you take advantage before it’s too late!",

    "markdown": "# Program Overview\n\nData has become a part of our daily lives. The Master of Science in Data Science & Analytics program combines data fundamentals and focused courses to train the next generation of data professionals. This analytics program emphasizes the inherently interdisciplinary nature of data science by addressing a broad range of applications across academic areas to provide students with a broad set of transferrable skills.\n\n![](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/06/20181016_GradSchoolStock_EducationTransformation-2792.jpg)\n\nThere are innumerable ways to use data in today’s world. Our program meets that need by providing our students with data science and analytics fundamentals, skills that translate across sectors and fields of work. We then give students a robust selection of elective courses that allow them to craft their own path. We believe that data can build the bridge to lasting social impact and it’s vital for our students to move toward their goals with not only the right skills, but passion as well.\n\n## Program Details\n\n236Program SizeAY 2023/2024\n\n16 monthsProgram LengthTime to complete program at minimum\n\n30Credits Number Needed to Graduate\n\n## Admissions Events\n\n![7 students sit on either side of a picnic table eating are facing the camera, smiling.](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/452/2023/11/f48cb3eb-2b69-46f5-adfb-8bb73e2fca3f-1024x1024.jpg)\n\nGet an inside look at the Data Science and Analytics program by attending an open house or admissions webinar!\n\n[Learn More](https://analytics.georgetown.edu/admissions-events/)\n\n## Enrollment and Course Scheduling\n\nCourses are offered during the fall semester (late August through early December) and the spring semester (early January through early May). A limited number of elective courses are offered during the summer semester. Courses typically meet once per week in the early afternoon, late afternoon, or early evening.\n\nStudents may enroll on a full-time or part-time basis, usually starting in the fall semester of each academic year. Full-time students will be able to complete the degree in 16 calendar months by taking three courses per semester for three semesters, plus a summer course. Students may, however, take up to three years to complete the program, e.g. by taking one or two courses per semester plus summer courses.\n\nThe Georgetown Data Science & Analytics (DSAN) program gives an online course in programming preparation that covers R, Python, and command line use in the summer prior to matriculation. The course is equivalent to three credits, is designed for matriculating MS Data Science & Analytics students, and is offered free of charge. It is required for all incoming students. This course runs during the Georgetown Summer Session (June – August). Students must complete this course to matriculate in the fall.",

The goal of this class is to explore techniques in NLP, with a strong emphasis on hands-on instruction that progressively matures basic Python users into expert Python developers. We will examine topics such as text classification, model evaluation, machine translation, and distributed representations. Throughout the semester, students will select and read a book on AI ethics to motivate discussions on the social impact of modern NLP technologies. Applications include authorship identification, retrieval, and textual similarity, to name a few.\nAbout half of the total class time is devoted to addressing an essential but often neglected piece in software development education: moving from typical data science programming workflows (such as writing basic scripts) to developing sophisticated Python projects. In other words, students will learn to design professional-grade software that they and others will be proud to contribute to together. Programming topics are explored in great depth, including Python best practices, object-oriented design, project structuring, and more. This class will give students the skills they need to contribute to the professional software repositories they work with already and even develop their own. _3 credits_. _**Offered in the Fall and Spring semesters.**_\n\n\n",

Students will explore and critically evaluate a range of data-related issues in contemporary society, such as responsible data collection, algorithmic bias, privacy, transparency, accountability, democratic participation in data usage and data-driven decisions, and the ethical implications of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning (self-driving cars, ChatGPT, crowd-sourced training data, etc.).\nThrough a combination of theoretical discussions and real-world case studies, students will examine the profound public policy and social issues associated with data ethics. This course will empower students by introducing a set of general ethical frameworks (consequentialism, deontological ethics, and virtue ethics) and discussing their relative strengths and weaknesses in terms of their ability to address modern ethical dilemmas and guide ethical decision-making processes in business, healthcare, government, and academia. These theoretical frameworks will then be discussed in light of more practical regulatory and policy considerations, so that students will have the tools they need to draw conclusions (in the form of their final projects) about best practices for data handling within a particular field or topic of interest to them.\nThe course will thus equip students with a robust ethical “toolbox” for conscientiously gathering, interpreting, and extracting meaning from data while respecting privacy, fairness, transparency, democratic accountability, and other social concerns. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n\n",

Data Analytics combines graph theory, optimization, data science, data visualization, community and cluster analysis, and more. Topics in this course will help answer intriguing questions such as, “How can we make sense of large, highly-associated data sets, ranging from social networks to the smart power grid?” or “Which models are more accurate for predicting popularity on Twitter?” or “How can we estimate the spread of a contagion or of information?” The course will begin with a discussion of applications, specifically to data science and analytics. From there, a formal framework for analysis of graphs and trees will be introduced. This will include graph theory and representation, optimization, and graph-based algorithms. Next packages in Python and/or R will be investigated for the purposes of exploring and visualizing data that contain relationships. These packages will then be used to model and analyze complex data sets for the purposes of community detection, path analysis, influencer assessment, logistics analytics, contagion or information spread (such as rumor spreading), web page ranking, and more. Examples of data science applications are provided with real-world data sets including social network data, web-based data, attributed data, flow data, biological data, and more. _3 credits_. _**Offered in the Summer semester.**_\n\n\n",

We also give a zero-credit programming bootcamp course in the summer prior to matriculation. The additional five three-credit elective courses allow students to learn tailored skills, helping them apply data analysis to fields of interest. Coursework may be taken in any order that is allowed by the prerequisites.\n\nCourses will be offered during the fall semester (late August through early December) and the spring semester (early January through early May). In addition, summer courses may be offered. Courses will typically meet once per week in the late afternoon or early evening.\n\nStudents may enroll on a full-time or part-time basis, usually starting in the fall semester of each academic year. Full-time students will be able to complete the degree in 16 calendar months by taking three courses per semester for three semesters, plus a summer course. Students may, however, take up to three years to complete the program, e.g. by taking one or two courses per semester plus summer courses.\n\nThe Georgetown DSAN program gives an online course in programming preparation that covers R, Python, and command line use in the summer prior to matriculation. The course is equivalent to three credits, is designed for matriculating MS Data Science & Analytics students, and is offered free of charge. It is required for all incoming students. This course will run during the Georgetown Summer Session (June – August). Students must complete this course to matriculate in the fall.\n\n## Full-Time Course Plan\n\n##### Fall Semester: Year One\n\n| Course Name | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN 5000 Data Science and Analytics (Core Course) | 3 |\n| DSAN 5100 Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Computing (Core Course) | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n\n##### Spring Semester:Year One\n\n| Course Name | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5200: Analytical Data Visualization (Core Course) | 3 |\n| DSAN-5300: Statistical Learning (Core Course) | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n\n##### Summer Semester between Year One and Year Two-Optional\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5925: Internship | .25 |\n\n**OR**\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective(s) | 3 (each) |\n\n##### Fall Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-6000: Big Data and Cloud Computing (Core Course) | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n\n##### Spring Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective | 3 |\n| Internship (Optional) | .25 |\n\nNote: You can graduate sooner by taking your final elective in the fall semester.\n\n## Part-Time Course Plan\n\n#### Fall Semester: Year One\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5000: Data Science and Analytics | 3 |\n| DSAN-5100: Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Computing | 3 |\n\n#### Spring Semester: Year One\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5200: Analytical Data Visualization | 3 |\n| DSAN-5300: Statistical Learning | 3 |\n\n#### Fall Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-6000: Big Data and Cloud Computing | 3 |\n| Elective | 3 |\n\n#### Spring Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective | 3 |\n| Elective | 3 |\n\n#### Fall Semester: Year Three\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective | 3 |\n| Elective | 3 |\n\n**Note: PT DSAN students may take 1 or 2 classes per semester, provided degree requirements are completed within 3 calendar years.

We also give a zero-credit programming bootcamp course in the summer prior to matriculation. The additional five three-credit elective courses allow students to learn tailored skills, helping them apply data analysis to fields of interest. Coursework may be taken in any order that is allowed by the prerequisites.\n\nCourses will be offered during the fall semester (late August through early December) and the spring semester (early January through early May). In addition, summer courses may be offered. Courses will typically meet once per week in the late afternoon or early evening.\n\nStudents may enroll on a full-time or part-time basis, usually starting in the fall semester of each academic year. Full-time students will be able to complete the degree in 16 calendar months by taking three courses per semester for three semesters, plus a summer course. Students may, however, take up to three years to complete the program, e.g. by taking one or two courses per semester plus summer courses.\n\nThe Georgetown DSAN program gives an online course in programming preparation that covers R, Python, and command line use in the summer prior to matriculation. The course is equivalent to three credits, is designed for matriculating MS Data Science & Analytics students, and is offered free of charge. It is required for all incoming students. This course will run during the Georgetown Summer Session (June – August). Students must complete this course to matriculate in the fall.\n\n## Full-Time Course Plan\n\n##### Fall Semester: Year One\n\n| Course Name | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN 5000 Data Science and Analytics (Core Course) | 3 |\n| DSAN 5100 Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Computing (Core Course) | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n\n##### Spring Semester:Year One\n\n| Course Name | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5200: Analytical Data Visualization (Core Course) | 3 |\n| DSAN-5300: Statistical Learning (Core Course) | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n\n##### Summer Semester between Year One and Year Two-Optional\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5925: Internship | .25 |\n\n**OR**\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective(s) | 3 (each) |\n\n##### Fall Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-6000: Big Data and Cloud Computing (Core Course) | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n| Elective Course | 3 |\n\n##### Spring Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective | 3 |\n| Internship (Optional) | .25 |\n\nNote: You can graduate sooner by taking your final elective in the fall semester.\n\n## Part-Time Course Plan\n\n#### Fall Semester: Year One\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5000: Data Science and Analytics | 3 |\n| DSAN-5100: Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Computing | 3 |\n\n#### Spring Semester: Year One\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-5200: Analytical Data Visualization | 3 |\n| DSAN-5300: Statistical Learning | 3 |\n\n#### Fall Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| DSAN-6000: Big Data and Cloud Computing | 3 |\n| Elective | 3 |\n\n#### Spring Semester: Year Two\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective | 3 |\n| Elective | 3 |\n\n#### Fall Semester: Year Three\n\n| Course | Credits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Elective | 3 |\n| Elective | 3 |\n\n**Note: PT DSAN students may take 1 or 2 classes per semester, provided degree requirements are completed within 3 calendar years.

The discipline of reinforcement learning focuses on how intelligent agents learn to perform actions, inside a specified environment, to maximize a cumulative reward function. Over the past several decades, there has been a push to incorporate concepts from the field of deep-learning into the agents used in RL algorithms. This has spawned the field of deep reinforcement learning. To date, the field of deep RL has yielded stunning results in a wide range of technological applications. These include, but are not limited to, self-driving cars, autonomous game play, robotics, trading and finance, and Natural Language Processing. This course will begin with an introduction to the fundamentals of traditional, i.e. non-deep, reinforcement learning. After reviewing fundamental deep learning topics the course will transition to deep RL by incorporating artificial neural networks into the models. The course includes a coding emphasis to showcase applied implementations of RL within the python ecosystem. Topics include multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, function approximation via neural networks, Markov decision processes, Monte Carlo methods, temporal difference learning, deep Q-learning, actor-critic methods, and policy gradient methods.

OpenAI’s infamous generative LLM, ChatGPT, became the fastest-growing consumer application in history in only two months–and the feverish interest around LLMs continues to grow. This course is concerned with applying LLMs to natural language processing (NLP) problems in real-life settings. This is a seminar-based course, so students will spend the majority of time outside of class reading, with in-class time dedicated to presenting and discussing recent research developments in NLP. The course will begin with a review of the transformer architecture that underlies LLMs and describe its prominent role in modern NLP. Then, we will discuss modern issues using transformers, including: the training and scaling of transformer-based models, variations on the classic transformer, transfer learning in low-resource settings, model deployment, distributed systems, and more. Meta-learning, multimodal learning, and societal impact will also be covered. Students will work on applications such as cross-language information retrieval, machine translation, prompt engineering, and select tasks outside of NLP. By the end of the course, students will have mastered transformer-based models and will be poised to use them at the cutting edge of NLP practice today. _3 credits._ _**Offered in the Spring semester.**_\n\n\n",
