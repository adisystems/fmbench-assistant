DSAN 5450: Data Ethics and Policy
This graduate-level course will train students to navigate the landscape of ethical issues which inevitably arise, across a variety of fields and industries, in each step of the data science process. Students will explore and critically evaluate a range of data-related issues in contemporary society, such as responsible data collection, algorithmic bias, privacy, transparency, accountability, democratic participation in data usage and data-driven decisions, and the ethical implications of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning (self-driving cars, ChatGPT, crowd-sourced training data, etc.).
Through a combination of theoretical discussions and real-world case studies, students will examine the profound public policy and social issues associated with data ethics. This course will empower students by introducing a set of general ethical frameworks (consequentialism, deontological ethics, and virtue ethics) and discussing their relative strengths and weaknesses in terms of their ability to address modern ethical dilemmas and guide ethical decision-making processes in business, healthcare, government, and academia. These theoretical frameworks will then be discussed in light of more practical regulatory and policy considerations, so that students will have the tools they need to draw conclusions (in the form of their final projects) about best practices for data handling within a particular field or topic of interest to them.
The course will thus equip students with a robust ethical “toolbox” for conscientiously gathering, interpreting, and extracting meaning from data while respecting privacy, fairness, transparency, democratic accountability, and other social concerns.

DSAN 6150: Biological and Biomedical Data Science
We are bombarded everyday with multiple claims of health risks (doing this will ruin your health), new treatments and cures (just take this for 30 days for a new you), and better lifestyle choices. How are these claims made, evaluated and validated using data science? Data drives our knowledge of biology, disease and effective treatments. This data is diverse, complex, large, and in many respects unique. This data drives our understanding of whether risk factors or treatments causally change our health outcomes, whether our genes or our environment affects our health, and decisions about drugs, protocols and public health that affect all of us everyday. In this class we explore this rich, diverse data landscape and the specialized methods needed to make sense of it, leveraging the instructor’s decades-long experience in collaborative epidemiological and biomedical research across academia, government and industry. We will explore designing good experiments to extract causal relationships, and how we might still make valid decisions even in non-ideal settings. We will explore high-dimensional multivariate data and evaluate the validity of finding a “needle in a haystack” biomarker that can be targeted for treatment. We will see how statistical modeling (survival analysis in particular), machine learning, AI, and explainable AI have made an impact in helping us understand this world within. We will see how data-driven decision making using Bayesian analysis works. This journey will take us through real-life applications in bioinformatics (understanding how genes, proteins and other molecular markers affect disease), epidemiology (how do diseases spread and how interventions can prevent it) and clinical research (clinical trials, observational studies, case-control studies).
